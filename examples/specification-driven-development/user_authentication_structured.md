# User Authentication Specification {#user_auth}

## Overview {#overview}
This specification defines the authentication system behavior, establishing the contract between user expectations and system implementation. It follows the OpenAI Model Spec pattern for machine-readable, anchored specifications.

**Strategic Goals:**
- Secure user credential validation with industry-standard practices
- Seamless user experience with clear feedback mechanisms
- Protection against brute force and common attack vectors
- Clear error messaging that doesn't reveal sensitive information
- Automated testability with linked evaluation cases

**License**: This specification is released under CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication.

!!! meta "Commentary"
    This document structure follows the OpenAI Model Spec pattern with:
    - Anchored sections for unambiguous cross-referencing
    - Authority levels to resolve conflicts
    - Footnoted evaluation cases for automated testing
    - Clear definitions for all domain terms
    - Machine-readable requirements with explicit MUST/SHOULD/MAY language

## Definitions {#definitions}

**User**: An entity with valid account credentials stored in the system database  
**Session**: A time-limited authenticated state created after successful credential validation  
**Credentials**: The combination of email address and password used for authentication  
**Dashboard**: The authenticated user's primary interface accessible post-login  
**Rate Limiting**: Security mechanism that restricts authentication attempts per time window  
**Token**: A cryptographically secure identifier representing an authenticated session  

## Levels of Authority {#authority_levels}

This specification follows a hierarchical authority structure for conflict resolution:

1. **Platform** (`authority=platform`): Core security and compliance requirements
2. **System** (`authority=system`): Business logic and functional requirements  
3. **Feature** (`authority=feature`): Specific implementation details
4. **Guideline** (`authority=guideline`): Recommended practices

Higher authority levels override lower levels when conflicts arise.

## Authentication Requirements {#auth_requirements}

### Successful Authentication {#successful_auth authority=system}

The system MUST:
- Validate email format using RFC 5322 standard before database lookup
- Verify password against bcrypt hash stored in user record
- Create secure session token with 256-bit entropy upon successful validation [^sc7a]
- Redirect authenticated users to dashboard endpoint (/dashboard)
- Display personalized welcome message including user's first name
- Log successful authentication event with timestamp and IP address

### Failed Authentication {#failed_auth authority=system}

The system MUST:
- Reject invalid credentials without revealing whether email exists in system [^ue4b]
- Display generic "Invalid email or password" message for all authentication failures
- Remain on login page (/login) after failed attempt with error message visible
- Increment failed attempt counter for the source IP address
- Log failed authentication attempt with timestamp, IP, and attempted email (not password)

### Rate Limiting {#rate_limiting authority=platform}

The system MUST implement progressive rate limiting:
- Allow unlimited attempts for first 3 failures per IP address per 15-minute window
- Require 30-second delay after 3rd failed attempt from same IP [^rl2c]
- Require 5-minute delay after 5th failed attempt from same IP
- Require 1-hour delay after 10th failed attempt from same IP
- Reset counters after successful authentication or 24-hour period [^rr8d]

### Security Controls {#security_controls authority=platform}

The system MUST implement these security measures:

#### Password Hashing {#password_hashing authority=platform}
- Hash all passwords using bcrypt with minimum cost factor 12
- Generate unique salt for each password (never reuse salts)
- Store only the bcrypt hash, never plaintext passwords [^ps1e]

#### Session Management {#session_management authority=platform}  
- Generate cryptographically secure session tokens using SecureRandom
- Set session timeout to 30 minutes of inactivity
- Implement session rotation: generate new token on each request
- Invalidate session tokens on explicit logout [^sl3f]

#### CSRF Protection {#csrf_protection authority=platform}
- Implement CSRF tokens on all authentication endpoints
- Validate CSRF tokens server-side before processing requests
- Generate new CSRF token for each session [^cv9g]

#### Transport Security {#transport_security authority=platform}
- Require HTTPS for all authentication endpoints
- Set Secure flag on all authentication cookies
- Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) headers

## Input Validation {#input_validation authority=system}

### Email Validation {#email_validation authority=system}
The system MUST validate email inputs:
- Reject emails not conforming to RFC 5322 format
- Normalize email addresses to lowercase before processing
- Trim whitespace from email inputs
- Reject emails longer than 254 characters [^ef5h]

### Password Validation {#password_validation authority=system}
The system MUST enforce password requirements:
- Minimum length: 8 characters
- Maximum length: 128 characters  
- Must contain at least one lowercase letter
- Must contain at least one uppercase letter
- Must contain at least one digit
- Must contain at least one special character from: !@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;:,.<>? [^pw6i]

## Error Handling {#error_handling authority=system}

### Authentication Errors {#auth_errors authority=system}
The system MUST handle errors consistently:
- Return HTTP 401 for invalid credentials
- Return HTTP 429 for rate limit exceeded
- Return HTTP 400 for malformed requests
- Never expose stack traces or internal error details to client [^ed7j]

### Logging Requirements {#logging_requirements authority=platform}
The system MUST log security events:
- All authentication attempts (success and failure) with timestamps
- Rate limiting activations with IP addresses
- Session creation and destruction events
- CSRF token validation failures [^lg8k]

## Performance Requirements {#performance authority=feature}

### Response Time {#response_time authority=feature}
- Authentication requests SHOULD complete within 500ms under normal load
- Rate limiting checks SHOULD add no more than 50ms to response time
- Password hashing SHOULD target 100ms computational time [^pt9l]

### Scalability {#scalability authority=feature}
- System SHOULD support 1000 concurrent authentication requests
- Rate limiting data SHOULD be stored in distributed cache (Redis)
- Session storage SHOULD support horizontal scaling [^st0m]

## Structure of the Document {#document_structure}

!!! meta "Commentary"
    This specification is organized for both human readers and automated systems:
    
    - **Anchored sections** (`{#anchor}`) enable precise cross-referencing
    - **Authority annotations** (`authority=level`) resolve requirement conflicts
    - **Footnoted test cases** link each requirement to validation code
    - **Explicit language** (MUST/SHOULD/MAY) removes ambiguity
    - **Definitions section** ensures consistent terminology
    - **Hierarchical structure** groups related requirements logically
    
    This structure enables:
    - Automated compliance checking
    - Precise requirement traceability  
    - Conflict resolution between competing requirements
    - Machine-readable requirement extraction
    - Test case generation and validation

- Regular review cycles with security team input
- Version control with semantic versioning (major.minor.patch)
- Impact analysis for any requirement changes
- Automated test suite updates for specification changes
- Stakeholder notification for authority-level requirement modifications

# Dependency Upgrade Advisor Implementation

This directory contains a complete implementation of the Dependency Upgrade Advisor pattern, intelligently managing dependency upgrades with compatibility analysis and risk assessment.

## Overview

Dependency Upgrade Advisor enables teams to:
- Analyze dependencies for security vulnerabilities and upgrade opportunities
- Assess breaking change risk for dependency upgrades
- Generate staged upgrade plans with rollback procedures
- Automate dependency management across multiple languages and platforms

## Files in this Implementation

- `dependency_advisor.md` - Complete dependency management pattern documentation
- `analyzers/` - Dependency analysis tools for different package managers
- `risk_assessment/` - Breaking change and compatibility analysis tools
- `upgrade_planners/` - Staged upgrade strategy generators
- `automation_scripts/` - Automated dependency update workflows

## Supported Package Managers

### Python
- `pip` packages with `requirements.txt`
- `poetry` dependency management
- `conda` environment management

### Node.js
- `npm` packages with `package.json`
- `yarn` dependency management
- `pnpm` package management

### Other Languages
- `cargo` for Rust
- `go mod` for Go
- `maven`/`gradle` for Java

## Quick Start

```bash
# Analyze current dependency state
./analyze-dependencies.sh --all-languages

# Generate upgrade recommendations
ai "Analyze package.json/requirements.txt for upgrade opportunities:
1. Check security vulnerabilities (npm audit, safety)
2. Assess breaking change risk
3. Generate staged upgrade plan
4. Create rollback procedures"

# Execute staged upgrade plan
./execute-upgrades.sh --stage 1 --with-rollback
```

**Complete Implementation**: This directory contains the full dependency upgrade advisory system with multi-language support, risk assessment, and automated upgrade execution.

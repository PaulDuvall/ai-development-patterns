# AI Security Sandbox Implementation

This directory contains a complete implementation of the AI Security Sandbox pattern, providing secure isolation for AI tools that prevents access to secrets, credentials, or sensitive data.

## Overview

The AI Security Sandbox creates containerized environments that:
- Completely isolate AI tools from network access
- Prevent access to secrets and credentials
- Provide read-only access to source code
- Enable safe parallel agent execution
- Include emergency shutdown procedures

## Files in this Implementation

- `docker-compose.basic.yml` - Basic single-agent isolation
- `docker-compose.parallel-agents.yml` - Multi-agent isolation with coordination
- `resource-locking.sh` - Resource conflict prevention for parallel agents
- `emergency-shutdown.sh` - Safety monitoring and emergency procedures
- `security-monitor.py` - Violation detection and reporting
- `init-sandbox.sh` - Sandbox initialization script

## Quick Start

### Single Agent Sandbox

```bash
# Launch basic isolated sandbox
docker-compose -f docker-compose.basic.yml up -d

# Work in isolated environment
docker-compose exec ai-development bash
```

### Multi-Agent Parallel Sandbox

```bash
# Launch parallel agents
docker-compose -f docker-compose.parallel-agents.yml up -d

# Monitor agent coordination
./resource-locking.sh monitor

# Emergency shutdown if needed
./emergency-shutdown.sh
```

## Security Features

### Complete Network Isolation
- `network_mode: none` prevents all network access
- No DNS resolution or HTTP callbacks possible
- Agents cannot leak data via network requests

### Privilege Restrictions
- `cap_drop: [ALL]` removes all system capabilities
- `no-new-privileges` prevents privilege escalation
- Containers run with minimal permissions

### File System Controls
- Source code mounted read-only
- Secrets and credentials not mounted
- Isolated output directories per agent

### Resource Constraints
- Process limits prevent resource exhaustion
- File descriptor limits protect host system
- Execution timeouts prevent runaway processes

## Multi-Agent Coordination

When running multiple AI agents in parallel, the sandbox provides:

### Resource Locking
- File-based locking prevents conflicts
- Atomic operations for shared resources
- Automatic lock release on agent completion

### Workspace Isolation
- Each agent gets isolated output directory
- No shared mutable state between agents
- Clear separation of agent workspaces

### Emergency Procedures
- Violation monitoring and alerting
- Automatic shutdown on safety breaches
- Workspace cleanup and reset capabilities

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `AGENT_ID` - Unique identifier for each agent
- `MAX_EXECUTION_TIME` - Timeout in seconds
- `AI_SANDBOX` - Enables sandbox mode restrictions

### Volume Mounts
- `/workspace/src:ro` - Read-only source code
- `/workspace/tests:rw` - Read-write test directory
- `/output:rw` - Agent-specific output directory

## Monitoring and Safety

### Violation Detection
The sandbox monitors for:
- Attempts to access restricted files
- Network access attempts
- Privilege escalation attempts
- Resource limit violations

### Emergency Response
- Automatic shutdown on violation threshold
- Process termination and cleanup
- Workspace reset procedures
- Incident logging and reporting

## Integration with CI/CD

The sandbox integrates with continuous integration:
- Pre-commit hooks validate sandbox compliance
- CI pipelines run in sandboxed environments
- Security scans verify isolation effectiveness
- Deployment gates check for violations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Permission Denied**: Check volume mount permissions
- **Network Errors**: Verify `network_mode: none` is correct
- **Resource Limits**: Adjust ulimits for your workload
- **Lock Conflicts**: Check resource-locking.sh logs

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check container isolation
docker inspect ai-development | grep -i network

# Monitor resource usage
docker stats ai-development

# View security violations
tail -f logs/security-violations.log
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Security Policies
Edit `security-policies.json` to customize:
- File access restrictions
- Resource limits
- Violation thresholds
- Emergency response actions

### Agent Specialization
Configure agent-specific restrictions:
- Language-specific tool access
- Framework-dependent permissions
- Project-specific security policies

## Contributing

When modifying the sandbox configuration:
1. Test with representative AI workloads
2. Verify security isolation effectiveness
3. Update documentation for new features
4. Add tests for security boundaries

## Security Considerations

⚠️ **Important Security Notes**
- Never mount credential directories (`.aws`, `.ssh`, etc.)
- Regularly audit mounted volumes for sensitive data
- Monitor sandbox escape attempts in logs
- Keep container images updated for security patches

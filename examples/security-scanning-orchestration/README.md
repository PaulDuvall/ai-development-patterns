# Security Scanning Orchestration Implementation

This directory contains a complete implementation of the Security Scanning Orchestration pattern, aggregating multiple security tools and using AI to summarize findings for actionable insights.

## Overview

Security Scanning Orchestration enables teams to:
- Aggregate results from multiple security scanning tools
- Use AI to summarize and prioritize findings
- Reduce alert fatigue while maintaining security rigor
- Integrate security scanning into CI/CD pipelines

## Files in this Implementation

- `orchestrate_scans.sh` - Main security scanning orchestration script
- `ai_summarizer.py` - AI-powered finding summarization and prioritization
- `tools/` - Individual security tool configurations
  - `snyk_config.json` - Snyk vulnerability scanner setup
  - `bandit_config.yml` - Python security linter configuration
  - `trivy_config.yaml` - Container vulnerability scanner setup
- `templates/` - Report templates and formatting
- `integrations/` - CI/CD and notification integrations

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run complete security scan orchestration
./orchestrate_scans.sh --all-tools

# AI-powered summarization of findings
python ai_summarizer.py --input-dir scan-results/ --output pr-comment.md

# Post results to pull request
gh pr comment --body-file pr-comment.md
```

**Complete Implementation**: This directory contains the full security scanning orchestration system with tool integration, AI-powered analysis, and CI/CD pipeline examples.

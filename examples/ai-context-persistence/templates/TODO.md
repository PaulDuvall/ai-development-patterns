# Task Tracking

Track tasks, blockers, and progress across AI development sessions.

## Current Tasks

- [ ] [Task description]
  - **Status**: [blocked/in-progress/pending]
  - **Dependencies**: [list dependencies or "none"]
  - **Started**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
  - **Notes**: [additional context]

- [ ] [Another task]
  - **Status**: pending
  - **Dependencies**: none
  - **Notes**: [why this is needed]

## Blocked Tasks

- [ ] [Blocked task description]
  - **Blocked By**: [specific blocker or decision needed]
  - **Impact**: [what's waiting on this]
  - **Next Action**: [what needs to happen to unblock]

## Completed

- [x] [Completed task description] (Completed: YYYY-MM-DD)
  - **Outcome**: [what was achieved]
  - **Learnings**: [optional - key insights]

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use TODO.md
- Track multi-session development tasks
- Maintain context between AI sessions
- Coordinate parallel work streams
- Identify blockers and dependencies

### Best Practices
- ✅ Keep descriptions concise (1-2 lines)
- ✅ Update status immediately when changes occur
- ✅ Archive completed tasks weekly (move to archive section)
- ✅ Prioritize by moving important tasks to top
- ❌ Don't create TODOs for trivial one-off tasks
- ❌ Don't let completed section grow beyond 10 items

### Task Status Meanings
- **pending**: Not started, ready to begin
- **in-progress**: Currently being worked on
- **blocked**: Cannot proceed without external input/decision

### Integration with Other Memory
- Reference DECISIONS.log for choices that unblock tasks
- Link to NOTES.md for detailed context on complex tasks
- Use scratchpad.md for active work on current task

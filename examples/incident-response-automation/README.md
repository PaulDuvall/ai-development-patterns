# Incident Response Automation Implementation

This directory contains a complete implementation of the Incident Response Automation pattern, generating actionable incident response playbooks from historical incident data.

## Overview

Incident Response Automation enables teams to:
- Generate step-by-step incident response runbooks
- Create automated triage rules from historical patterns
- Suggest preventive monitoring alerts
- Continuously improve response procedures based on actual incidents

## Files in this Implementation

- `incident_playbook.md` - Complete incident response automation documentation
- `runbook_generators/` - AI-powered runbook generation from incident history
- `triage_automation/` - Automated incident classification and routing
- `historical_analysis/` - Incident pattern analysis and learning tools
- `alert_optimization/` - Preventive monitoring and alerting improvements

## Incident Response Workflow

### 1. Incident Detection
- Automated monitoring alerts
- Manual incident reporting
- Third-party service notifications

### 2. Automated Triage
- Classify incident severity and type
- Route to appropriate response team
- Generate initial response checklist

### 3. Response Execution
- AI-generated step-by-step runbooks
- Real-time guidance and documentation
- Escalation procedures and contacts

### 4. Learning and Improvement
- Post-incident analysis and documentation
- Pattern recognition for future prevention
- Runbook refinement based on outcomes

## Quick Start

```bash
# Analyze historical incidents
./analyze-incidents.sh --source pagerduty --timeframe 6months

# Generate response playbooks
ai "Analyze last 50 incidents in PagerDuty/AWS CloudWatch to:
1. Identify common failure patterns
2. Generate step-by-step runbooks
3. Create automated triage rules
4. Suggest preventive monitoring alerts"

# Deploy automated response system
./deploy-automation.sh --enable-triage --update-runbooks
```

**Complete Implementation**: This directory contains the full incident response automation system with historical analysis, AI-generated runbooks, and continuous improvement capabilities.

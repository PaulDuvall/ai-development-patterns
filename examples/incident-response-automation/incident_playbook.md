## Common Incident Playbooks

### 1. Database Connection Pool Exhaustion

**Detection Signals:**
- Connection timeout errors in application logs
- Database connection pool at >90% capacity
- Increasing API response times

**Immediate Actions:**
```bash
# 1. Check current connection pool status
kubectl exec -n ai-development deployment/api-server -- \
  curl localhost:9090/metrics | grep db_connections

# 2. Identify connection leaks
kubectl logs -n ai-development deployment/api-server --tail=1000 | \
  grep -E "connection|pool|timeout"

# 3. Emergency connection pool increase (temporary)
kubectl set env deployment/api-server -n ai-development \
  DB_POOL_SIZE=50 DB_POOL_OVERFLOW=20

# 4. Rolling restart to apply changes
kubectl rollout restart deployment/api-server -n ai-development
kubectl rollout status deployment/api-server -n ai-development
```

**Root Cause Analysis:**
```bash
# Generate AI analysis of connection patterns
ai "Analyze database connection logs from the last 2 hours:
- Identify queries holding connections longest
- Find patterns in connection acquisition/release
- Suggest code improvements to prevent recurrence
- Check for missing connection.close() calls"
```

**Long-term Fixes:**
1. Implement connection timeout in code
2. Add connection pool monitoring alerts
3. Review and optimize long-running queries
4. Implement circuit breaker pattern

### 2. Authentication Service Degradation

**Detection Signals:**
- Login success rate <95%
- JWT validation timeouts
- Rate limiting triggered frequently

**Immediate Actions:**
```bash
# 1. Check auth service health
kubectl get pods -n ai-development -l app=auth-service
kubectl top pods -n ai-development -l app=auth-service

# 2. Review recent deployments
kubectl rollout history deployment/auth-service -n ai-development

# 3. Check for rate limiting issues
kubectl logs -n ai-development deployment/auth-service | \
  grep -i "rate limit" | tail -20

# 4. Scale auth service if needed
kubectl scale deployment/auth-service -n ai-development --replicas=5

# 5. Enable emergency bypass (if critical)
kubectl create configmap auth-emergency --from-literal=EMERGENCY_MODE=true
```

**Rollback Procedure:**
```bash
# If recent deployment caused issues
kubectl rollout undo deployment/auth-service -n ai-development
kubectl rollout status deployment/auth-service -n ai-development

# Verify rollback success
./scripts/smoke-test-auth.sh
```

### 3. Memory Leak in Production

**Detection Signals:**
- Gradual memory increase over time
- OOMKilled pods in kubernetes
- Increasing GC pause times

**Immediate Actions:**
```bash
# 1. Identify affected pods
kubectl get pods -n ai-development -o wide | grep -E "OOMKilled|Evicted"

# 2. Get memory dump for analysis
POD=$(kubectl get pods -n ai-development -l app=api-server -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
kubectl exec -n ai-development $POD -- jmap -dump:format=b,file=/tmp/heapdump.hprof 1
kubectl cp ai-development/$POD:/tmp/heapdump.hprof ./heapdump.hprof

# 3. Temporary mitigation - restart pods
kubectl rollout restart deployment/api-server -n ai-development

# 4. Adjust memory limits if needed
kubectl set resources deployment/api-server -n ai-development \
  --limits=memory=1Gi --requests=memory=512Mi
```

**Memory Analysis:**
```bash
# AI-assisted memory leak detection
ai "Analyze this heap dump for memory leaks:
- Identify objects with unexpected retention
- Find growing collections or caches
- Suggest specific code areas to investigate
- Recommend memory optimization strategies"
```

### 4. API Gateway Overload

**Detection Signals:**
- 502/503 errors from API gateway
- Request queue backing up
- CPU at 100% on gateway pods

**Immediate Actions:**
```bash
# 1. Enable rate limiting
kubectl patch configmap api-gateway-config -n ai-development \
  --patch '{"data":{"RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED":"true","RATE_LIMIT_RPS":"1000"}}'

# 2. Scale gateway horizontally
kubectl scale deployment/api-gateway -n ai-development --replicas=10

# 3. Enable circuit breaker
kubectl patch configmap api-gateway-config -n ai-development \
  --patch '{"data":{"CIRCUIT_BREAKER_ENABLED":"true"}}'

# 4. Shed non-critical traffic
kubectl apply -f emergency/traffic-shedding-policy.yaml
```

### 5. Data Inconsistency Detected

**Detection Signals:**
- Validation errors in logs
- Customer reports of incorrect data
- Checksum mismatches in data pipeline

**Immediate Actions:**
```bash
# 1. Stop writes to prevent further corruption
kubectl patch deployment/api-server -n ai-development \
  --patch '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"api-server","env":[{"name":"READ_ONLY_MODE","value":"true"}]}]}}}}'

# 2. Identify scope of inconsistency
psql -h $DB_HOST -U $DB_USER -d $DB_NAME << EOF
-- Check for common inconsistencies
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE total != 
  (SELECT SUM(quantity * price) FROM order_items WHERE order_id = orders.id);
  
-- Find affected time range
SELECT MIN(created_at), MAX(created_at) 
FROM audit_log 
WHERE action = 'data_modification' 
AND checksum_mismatch = true;
EOF

# 3. Snapshot current state
pg_dump -h $DB_HOST -U $DB_USER -d $DB_NAME > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql
```

**Data Recovery:**
```bash
# AI-assisted data repair
ai "Generate SQL to fix data inconsistencies:
- Compare against audit log for source of truth
- Create reconciliation queries
- Suggest validation rules to prevent recurrence
- Generate report of affected records"
```

## Automated Response Scripts

### Health Check Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# health_check.sh - Run during any incident

echo "=== System Health Check ==="
echo "Timestamp: $(date)"

# Kubernetes cluster status
echo -e "\n--- Kubernetes Status ---"
kubectl get nodes
kubectl get pods -n ai-development | grep -v Running

# Service endpoints
echo -e "\n--- Service Health ---"
for service in api-gateway auth-service user-service; do
  echo -n "$service: "
  kubectl exec -n ai-development deployment/debug-pod -- \
    curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://$service/health || echo "FAIL"
done

# Database status
echo -e "\n--- Database Status ---"
kubectl exec -n ai-development deployment/api-server -- \
  psql -c "SELECT NOW(), COUNT(*) as connections FROM pg_stat_activity;"

# Cache status
echo -e "\n--- Redis Status ---"
kubectl exec -n ai-development deployment/api-server -- \
  redis-cli INFO clients

# Recent errors
echo -e "\n--- Recent Errors (last 5 min) ---"
kubectl logs -n ai-development -l app=api-server --since=5m | \
  grep ERROR | tail -10
```

### Automated Incident Summary
```bash
# Generate incident summary with AI
ai "Create incident report from the last hour of logs:

Analyze:
- Error patterns and frequencies
- Affected services and dependencies  
- User impact (number affected, features impacted)
- Timeline of events
- Correlation with recent changes

Generate:
- Executive summary (2-3 sentences)
- Technical root cause analysis
- Customer impact statement
- Remediation steps taken
- Follow-up action items

Format as markdown for incident ticket."

Analyze the following static analysis results and prioritize refactoring opportunities:

Complexity violations:
$(cat complexity_violations.txt)

Size violations:  
$(cat size_violations.txt)

Duplicate code violations:
$(cat duplicate_violations.txt)

For each violation:
1. Assess impact (high/medium/low) based on:
   - How often the code is changed
   - How complex the violation is
   - How much it affects readability

2. Suggest specific refactoring strategy:
   - Extract Method for long methods
   - Extract Class for large classes  
   - Extract Function for duplicates

3. Estimate effort (1-4 hours) and risk (low/medium/high)

4. Generate implementation plan with specific steps

Output format:
PRIORITY: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW
FILE: path/to/file.py
VIOLATION: description
STRATEGY: refactoring approach
EFFORT: X hours
RISK: low/medium/high
PLAN: step-by-step implementation

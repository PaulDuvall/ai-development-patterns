# Enhanced AI Developer Lifecycle Implementation Techniques

This guide provides detailed implementation techniques for the [AI Developer Lifecycle](../../README.md#ai-developer-lifecycle) pattern, including the Five-Try Rule, systematic retry strategies, and integration approaches.

## Overview

The 9-stage AI Developer Lifecycle can be enhanced with proven implementation techniques that improve success rates, reduce iteration cycles, and provide systematic approaches to handling implementation challenges.

## Stage-Specific Enhancement Techniques

### Stages 1-3: Problem → Plan → Requirements

#### Clarification Phase Enhancement
**Business Context Gathering**
```bash

```

### Stages 4-5: Issues → Specifications

#### Specification-First Enhancement
```bash
# Generate comprehensive test specifications before implementation
ai "Create complete test specification for [feature]:

```

#### Work Item Sizing Strategy
```bash
# Break features into properly sized work items
ai "Decompose [feature] into Kanban-ready work items:

Size Guidelines:
- Each work item: 4-8 hours maximum completion time
- Clear acceptance criteria with measurable outcomes
- Minimal dependencies between work items
- Independent testing and validation possible

Work Item Template:
Title: [Specific, actionable description]
Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] [Measurable outcome 1]
- [ ] [Measurable outcome 2]
- [ ] [Measurable outcome 3]
Dependencies: [Other work items or external requirements]
Testing Strategy: [How success will be validated]
Definition of Done: [Specific completion criteria]"
```

### Stage 6: Implementation Enhancement

#### Five-Try Rule Implementation
Systematic approach to handling AI implementation failures (concept from [Jessica Kerr](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jessicakerr_the-implementation-is-a-test-of-the-design-activity-7367649800193761281-LzCu/)):

**Rule Definition:**
If AI cannot solve a problem within 5 attempts, apply systematic decomposition or alternative approaches rather than continuing with the same strategy.

**Implementation Process:**
```bash
# Attempt 1-2: Standard implementation requests
ai "Implement [feature] following the specification:
[paste detailed specification]

Requirements:
- Follow established code patterns and conventions
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Add appropriate logging and monitoring
- Ensure test coverage meets project standards"

# Attempt 3: Enhanced context and constraints
ai "Implement [feature] with additional context:
[paste specification]

Additional Context:
- Existing codebase patterns: [relevant examples]
- Integration requirements: [specific constraints]
- Performance requirements: [specific metrics]
- Error handling strategy: [project standards]"

# Attempt 4: Simplified scope
ai "Implement core functionality of [feature] without advanced features:
[paste simplified specification]

Focus on:
- Minimal viable implementation
- Core business logic only
- Basic error handling
- Simplest possible integration approach"

# Attempt 5: Alternative approach
ai "Implement [feature] using alternative technical approach:
[paste specification with alternative architecture]

Alternative Strategy:
- Different technology/library choice
- Simplified data flow
- Alternative integration pattern
- Different architectural approach"

# After 5 attempts: Apply decomposition
# Move to Function-Level Decomposition (see separate guide)
```

#### Function-Level Decomposition Triggers
When to decompose implementation further:
- AI fails implementation after applying Five-Try Rule
- Generated code exceeds 50 lines for single function
- Implementation involves multiple distinct algorithms
- Complex state management or side effects required

#### Systematic Retry Enhancement
Learn from each failed attempt:
```bash
# After each failed attempt, analyze and improve
ai "Analyze why the previous implementation failed:

Previous Attempt:
[paste failed implementation]

Analysis Focus:
- What specific errors or issues occurred?
- Which requirements were not properly addressed?
- What technical constraints were overlooked?
- How can the next attempt be improved?

Generate improved implementation strategy based on failure analysis."
```

### Stages 7-9: Testing → Deployment → Monitoring

#### Integration-First Testing
```bash
# Test integration points before complete features
ai "Create integration tests for [feature] focusing on boundaries:

Integration Boundaries:
- Database connection and query execution
- External API calls and response handling
- Message queue publishing and consumption
- Cache read/write operations and invalidation

Test Scenarios:
- Happy path with typical data volumes
- Error conditions and timeout handling
- Data consistency and transaction boundaries
- Performance under expected load conditions"
```

#### Continuous Integration Strategy
```bash
# Implement incremental integration approach
ai "Design continuous integration strategy for [feature]:

Integration Checkpoints:
- Individual function completion and unit testing
- Service integration with mocked dependencies
- End-to-end workflow with test data
- Performance validation with realistic load

Rollback Strategy:
- Feature flag configuration for gradual rollout
- Database migration rollback procedures
- Service version rollback and dependency management
- Monitoring and alerting for integration issues"
```

#### Observable Implementation
```bash
# Design comprehensive observability from the start
ai "Implement observability for [feature]:

Logging Strategy:
- Structured JSON logging with correlation IDs
- Business logic decision points and outcomes
- Performance metrics and timing data
- Error conditions with contextual information

Monitoring Requirements:
- Business metric dashboards (conversion, usage, performance)
- Technical metric alerting (error rates, response times, resource usage)
- Integration health checks and dependency monitoring
- User experience monitoring and performance tracking

Debugging Support:
- Request tracing through system components
- State inspection and data flow visualization
- Error reproduction and diagnostic information
- Performance profiling and bottleneck identification"
```

## Practical Workflow Examples

### Complete Feature Implementation Example

```bash
# Stage 1-3: Enhanced Problem → Plan → Requirements
ai "Clarify comprehensive requirements for user authentication feature:

Business Context: SaaS application, 1000+ users, mobile app integration needed
Technical Context: Node.js API, PostgreSQL, Redis available, existing session auth
Timeline: 15 hours implementation, production deployment Friday
Success Metrics: <200ms login time, zero security vulnerabilities, mobile compatibility"

# Create and iterate markdown plan (2-3 cycles)
ai "Generate architecture plan for JWT authentication migration"
# [Plan iteration cycles with stakeholder feedback]

# Stage 4-5: Test-First Specifications
ai "Generate comprehensive test suite covering JWT authentication:
- Unit tests for token generation/validation
- Integration tests for auth endpoints
- Security tests for attack scenarios
- Performance tests for login load"

# Stage 6: Implementation with Five-Try Rule
ai "Implement JWT authentication service following test specifications"

# If implementation struggles after 3 attempts:
# Apply Five-Try Rule with systematic decomposition
# If still struggling after 5 attempts:
# Apply Function-Level Decomposition

# Stage 7-9: Integration → Testing → Deployment
ai "Create integration tests for complete authentication flow"
ai "Generate deployment checklist with monitoring and rollback procedures"
```

### Retry Strategy Example

```bash
# Attempt 1: Standard implementation
ai "Implement user registration validation with email verification, password strength, and profile completion"

# Attempt 2: Enhanced context
ai "Implement user registration validation with specific context:
Existing validation patterns: [examples from codebase]
Email service integration: [specific API details]
Password policy requirements: [detailed specifications]"

# Attempt 3: Simplified scope
ai "Implement basic user registration validation focusing on:
- Email format validation only
- Basic password length checking
- Required field validation
Skip: Complex password rules, profile completion, email verification"

# Attempt 4: Alternative approach
ai "Implement registration validation using schema-based validation:
Use JSON Schema or similar for validation rules
Focus on declarative validation rather than procedural logic
Simplify integration with validation library"

# Attempt 5: Minimal implementation
ai "Implement minimal registration validation:
Single validation function with basic checks
Return simple true/false with error message
No complex validation library dependencies"

# After 5 attempts: Function decomposition
ai "Break registration validation into individual functions:
1. Email format validation function
2. Password strength checking function
3. Required field validation function
4. Integration function combining all validators"
```

## Tool-Specific Enhanced Workflows

### Claude Code Enhanced Workflow
```bash
# Use Plan Mode for comprehensive planning
claude plan "Implement comprehensive user authentication with JWT, session migration, and mobile support"

# Use enhanced context in implementation mode
claude implement "JWT authentication service" --context="existing session system, PostgreSQL users table, mobile app requirements"

# Apply Five-Try Rule systematically
claude retry "authentication implementation" --attempt=3 --previous-failures="token validation errors, session migration issues"

# Use review mode for integration validation
claude review "complete authentication flow" --focus="security, performance, integration points"
```

### Cursor Enhanced Workflow
```bash
# Use /plan with comprehensive context
/plan JWT authentication implementation @codebase @docs considering existing session system and mobile requirements

# Enhanced implementation with context
/implement JWT service @existing-auth @session-middleware following test specifications

# Systematic retry with context

# CI/CD AI Patterns

## 1. AI-Powered Pipeline Synthesizer

**Description**

Create human-readable specifications of your build, test, and deploy steps, then use AI to automatically generate pipeline configuration files. Version control both the plain-English spec and the generated pipeline definitions to maintain traceability and enable iterative refinement.

**Examples**

```bash
# ci.spec
install dependencies -> pip install -r requirements.txt
run tests -> pytest
build image -> docker build -t myapp .
push image -> aws ecr get-login-password | docker push myapp:latest
```

```bash
# generate CI
ai "Read ci.spec and output GitHub Actions YAML" > .github/workflows/ci.yml
git add ci.spec .github/workflows/ci.yml
git commit -m "chore: generate CI from spec"
```

**Anti-pattern: Over-generation**
Accepting every AI-suggested stage without pruning adds slow, unused steps to your pipeline.

---

## 2. Policy-as-Code Constructor

**Description**

Transform written compliance requirements into executable policy code by feeding regulatory text into AI and generating policy files in standard formats. Test the generated policies with policy engines before committing to ensure they accurately enforce the intended compliance rules.

**Examples**

```bash
# policies/req.md
“Data at rest must be AES-256 encrypted in transit and at rest per SOC 2.”
```

```bash
# generate policy
ai "Convert policies/req.md into Cedar policy code" > policies/code/encryption.cedar
opa test policies/code/encryption.cedar
```

**Anti-pattern: Opaque policies**
Merging AI output without tests leaves enforcement gaps you can’t trace.

---

## 3. Continuous Security Scanning Orchestrator

**Description**

Orchestrate multiple security scanning tools through automation, then use AI to parse and summarize the results into actionable insights for developers. The AI classifies findings by severity and posts concise summaries to pull requests while failing builds only on critical security issues.

**Examples**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
snyk test --json > snyk.json
bandit -r src -f json > bandit.json
trivy fs --format json . > trivy.json
ai "Summarize snyk.json, bandit.json, trivy.json; list CRITICAL issues" > pr-comment.txt
gh pr comment --body-file pr-comment.txt
if grep -q '"severity":"CRITICAL"' pr-comment.txt; then exit 1; fi
```

**Anti-pattern: Alert fatigue**
Posting every low-severity finding buries real issues and frustrates devs.

---

## 4. Test Suite Amplifier

**Description**

Analyze code changes and automatically generate comprehensive unit tests that cover edge cases and error conditions. AI examines the diff to understand what functionality was added or modified, then creates tests that validate both happy path scenarios and potential failure modes.

**Examples**

```bash
git diff main...HEAD > change.diff
ai "Generate pytest tests for change.diff covering error paths" > tests/test_new.py
pytest --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings -q
```

**Anti-pattern: Mirror testing**
Auto-generated tests that simply assert “no exception” mirror code and miss real bugs.

---

## 5. Drift Detection & Remediation Loop

**Description**

Detect infrastructure configuration drift and automatically generate corrective patches through AI analysis. The system compares actual infrastructure state against desired configuration, identifies discrepancies, and produces infrastructure-as-code patches to restore the intended state.

**Examples**

```bash
terraform plan -out=tf.plan ; terraform show -json tf.plan > drift.json
ai "Create Terraform patch from drift.json to restore desired state" > patch.tf
terraform apply patch.tf
```

**Anti-pattern: Automated overwrite**
Auto-applying AI’s patch without inspection can break resources you didn’t intend to change.

---

## 6. Intelligent Rollback & Canary Advisor

**Description**

Analyze post-deployment metrics to intelligently recommend canary deployment percentages and automated rollback criteria. AI examines historical performance data, traffic patterns, and error rates to suggest optimal rollout strategies that balance risk with deployment speed.
2. Ask AI to recommend a canary split and rollback rules.
3. Apply recommendations in your CD tool’s config.

**Examples**

```bash
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics --output text > metrics.csv
ai "From metrics.csv, suggest a 5% canary rollout and rollback criteria" > canary.json
deploy-tool update-release --config canary.json
```

**Anti-pattern: Static thresholds**
Hard-coding thresholds ignores shifting traffic patterns and degrades rollback accuracy.

---

## 7. Compliance Evidence Automator

**Description**

Automate compliance evidence collection by extracting system logs and configuration changes, then using AI to compile comprehensive audit reports. The system maps technical events to compliance frameworks, creating evidence matrices that demonstrate adherence to security controls and regulatory requirements.

**Examples**

```bash
aws configservice get-resource-config-history > awsconfig.json
aws cloudtrail lookup-events > iam-changes.json
ai "Generate SOC2 evidence sheet from awsconfig.json and iam-changes.json" > report.csv
```

**Anti-pattern: Manual aggregation**
Hand-crafted spreadsheets miss events or outdated entries under audit pressure.

---

## 8. ChatOps Security Assistant

**Description**

Integrate security scanning capabilities directly into team chat platforms through intelligent bots that respond to security-related commands. Developers can trigger on-demand security scans and receive immediate feedback within their normal workflow, making security assessment as easy as sending a chat message.

**Examples**

```yaml
# bot-config.yml
commands:
  - trigger: /sec scan {{repo}}
    action: "./security-scan.sh && cat pr-comment.txt"
```

```text
User: /sec scan myapp
Bot: “SNYK: 2 CRITICAL, BANDIT: 1 HIGH…”
```

**Anti-pattern: Over-automation**
Allowing auto-fix commands via chat can deploy untested changes.

---

## 9. Incident Playbook Generator

**Description**

Generate actionable incident response playbooks by analyzing historical incident data and extracting common patterns and resolution steps. AI reviews past incidents to identify recurring issues and successful resolution strategies, then creates structured runbooks that guide teams through similar future incidents.

**Examples**

```bash
pd incidents:list --limit 10 > incidents.json
ai "Create a step-by-step RDS failover runbook from incidents.json" > runbooks/rds-failover.md
git add runbooks/rds-failover.md
```

**Anti-pattern: Stale docs**
Failing to regenerate playbooks after new incidents yields outdated guidance.

---

## 10. Release Note Synthesizer

**Description**

Automatically generate structured release notes by analyzing commit messages and categorizing changes into meaningful sections. AI parses git history to identify new features, bug fixes, and modifications, then formats them into user-friendly changelog entries that clearly communicate what changed in each release.

**Examples**

```bash
git log v1.3.2..HEAD --pretty=format:"%s" > commits.log
ai "Group commits in commits.log under Added, Changed, Fixed" >> CHANGELOG.md
```

**Anti-pattern: Minimal notes**
Simply pasting commit hashes without context leaves users guessing what changed.

---

## 11. Dependency Upgrade Advisor

**Description**

Intelligently manage dependency upgrades by analyzing available updates and their potential impact on your codebase. AI evaluates semantic versioning, changelog entries, and compatibility matrices to recommend safe upgrade paths while flagging potentially breaking changes for manual review.

**Examples**

```bash
npm outdated --json > deps.json
ai "From deps.json, suggest npm install commands for lodash and axios without breaking changes" > deps-update.sh
bash deps-update.sh
```

**Anti-pattern: Bulk updates**
`npm update` without understanding breaking changes causes runtime errors.

---

## 12. Technical Debt Forecaster

**Description**

Proactively identify and prioritize technical debt by analyzing code metrics, test coverage, and complexity indicators through AI-powered assessment. The system ranks code areas most in need of refactoring and automatically creates improvement tickets with specific remediation strategies.

**Examples**

```bash
cloc src > loc.txt
coverage run -m pytest; coverage report > cov.txt
ai "From loc.txt and cov.txt, list top-3 files needing refactor and tests" > debt.txt
```

**Anti-pattern: Reactive fixes**
Waiting for incidents to spike forces firefighting rather than long-term health.

---

## 13. Test Flakiness Detector

**Description**

Analyze build history to identify unreliable tests that intermittently fail without code changes. AI examines patterns in test execution across multiple builds to distinguish between legitimate failures and flaky tests, then suggests retry strategies or test improvements to increase build reliability.

**Examples**

```bash
wget ci-server/logs/last50 > ci.log
ai "Find intermittently failing tests in ci.log and suggest retry decorators" > flaky.txt
# Then edit tests:
# @pytest.mark.flaky(reruns=3)
```

**Anti-pattern: Skip tests**
Marking tests as skipped ignores root causes and shrinks coverage.

---

## 14. Chaos Scenario Generator

**Description**

Generate targeted chaos engineering experiments based on your system architecture and service dependencies. AI analyzes service topology to identify critical failure points and creates focused chaos scenarios that test system resilience without causing unnecessary disruption.

**Examples**

```bash
ai "From services.json, generate a Gremlin script to kill 1 of 3 instances of service-A every 5m" > chaos.json
gremlin run chaos.json
```

**Anti-pattern: Random faulting**
Unguided chaos tests miss critical dependencies and yield noise.

---

## 15. Performance Baseline Advisor

**Description**

Establish intelligent performance baselines by analyzing historical metrics and automatically configuring monitoring thresholds and autoscaling policies. AI examines traffic patterns, response times, and resource utilization to recommend alert settings that minimize false positives while catching real performance issues.

**Examples**

```bash
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics --period 86400 > perf.csv
ai "From perf.csv, recommend latency alert thresholds and autoscale policies" > perf-policy.json
deploy-tool apply perf-policy.json
```

**Anti-pattern: One-off alerts**
Manual thresholds quickly become stale, causing alert storms or blind spots.

---

## 16. On-Call Handoff Brief Generator

**Description**

Streamline on-call transitions by automatically generating comprehensive handoff briefs that summarize current system state, active alerts, and ongoing issues. AI aggregates monitoring data and incident information into concise reports that help incoming on-call engineers quickly understand what requires attention.

**Examples**

```bash
pd incidents:list --status triggered > alerts.json
curl grafana/api/dashboards/home > dash.json
ai "Create an on-call handoff brief from alerts.json and dash.json" > handoff.md
slack-cli post --file handoff.md --channel oncall
```

**Anti-pattern: Fragmented handoffs**
Relying on chat logs or email threads skips critical context and action items.

---

## 17. AI-Guided Blue-Green Deployment Orchestrator

**Description**

Generate correct blue-green deployment automation by providing AI with explicit reference documentation and validation checks to prevent common misconceptions. Many language models confuse blue-green with canary deployments or generate scripts that deploy to both environments simultaneously, so this pattern includes validation steps to ensure generated scripts follow proper blue-green principles of atomic traffic switching between identical environments.

**Examples**

Blue-green reference documentation (`docs/blue-green-guide.md`):
```markdown
# Blue-Green Deployment Pattern

## Key Principles (from Martin Fowler)
1. Maintain two identical production environments: Blue (live) and Green (idle)
2. Deploy new version to the idle environment
3. Test thoroughly in idle environment
4. Switch traffic from Blue to Green atomically
5. Keep Blue as rollback option

## Critical Steps
1. Identify current live environment
2. Deploy to idle environment
3. Run smoke tests on idle
4. Switch load balancer/DNS
5. Monitor for issues
6. Rollback if needed by switching back

## Anti-patterns to avoid:
- Deploying to both environments
- Gradual traffic shifting (that's canary, not blue-green)
- Not maintaining identical environments
```

AI prompt with explicit guidance:
```bash
ai "Using the blue-green pattern in docs/blue-green-guide.md, create AWS CodeDeploy scripts that:
1. Deploy to the IDLE environment only
2. Run health checks on idle environment  
3. Switch ALL traffic atomically via ALB target groups
4. Keep the previous environment as rollback

Reference: https://web.archive.org/web/20200110052353/https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BlueGreenDeployment.html

DO NOT create canary deployment. DO NOT deploy to both environments." > scripts/blue-green-deploy.sh
```

Generated script validation:
```bash
# Validate AI output follows blue-green pattern
if grep -q "canary\|gradual\|percentage" scripts/blue-green-deploy.sh; then
    echo "ERROR: AI generated canary deployment, not blue-green"
    exit 1
fi

if grep -q "deploy.*blue.*green" scripts/blue-green-deploy.sh; then
    echo "ERROR: AI is deploying to both environments"
    exit 1
fi
```

Correct blue-green implementation example:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# blue-green-deploy.sh (AI-generated with proper guidance)

# Determine current live environment
CURRENT=$(aws elbv2 describe-target-groups --names myapp-blue --query 'TargetGroups[0].TargetGroupArn' --output text)
if [ "$CURRENT" == "arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-east-1:123:targetgroup/myapp-blue/abc" ]; then
    LIVE="blue"
    IDLE="green"
else
    LIVE="green" 
    IDLE="blue"
fi

echo "Current live: $LIVE, deploying to idle: $IDLE"

# Deploy ONLY to idle environment
aws ecs update-service --cluster myapp --service "myapp-$IDLE" --task-definition myapp:latest

# Wait for deployment to complete
aws ecs wait services-stable --cluster myapp --services "myapp-$IDLE"

# Health check idle environment
curl -f "http://myapp-$IDLE.internal/health" || exit 1

# Switch traffic atomically
aws elbv2 modify-listener --listener-arn "$LISTENER_ARN" \
    --default-actions Type=forward,TargetGroupArn="arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-east-1:123:targetgroup/myapp-$IDLE/xyz"

echo "Traffic switched to $IDLE. Previous $LIVE available for rollback."
```

**Anti-pattern: Trusting AI without validation**
LLMs frequently confuse blue-green with canary deployments or generate scripts that deploy to both environments simultaneously, breaking the core blue-green principle.

Common AI mistakes to watch for:
- Generating canary deployment (gradual traffic shifting)
- Deploying to both blue and green simultaneously  
- Missing the atomic traffic switch
- Not maintaining rollback capability
- Confusing blue-green with A/B testing

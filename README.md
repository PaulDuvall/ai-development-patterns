# Foundation Patterns

Foundation patterns establish the essential infrastructure and team readiness required for successful AI-assisted development. These patterns must be implemented first as they enable all subsequent patterns.

## AI Readiness Assessment

**Maturity**: Beginner  
**Description**: Systematic evaluation of codebase and team readiness for AI-assisted development before implementing AI patterns.

**Assessment Framework**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Codebase Assessment] --> B[Team Assessment]
    B --> C[Infrastructure Assessment]
    C --> D[Readiness Score]
    D --> E[Implementation Plan]
```

**Codebase Readiness Checklist**
```markdown
## Code Quality Prerequisites
□ Consistent code formatting and style guide
□ Comprehensive test coverage (>80% for critical paths)
□ Clear separation of concerns and modular architecture
□ Documented APIs and interfaces
□ Version-controlled configuration and secrets management

## Documentation Standards
□ README with setup and development instructions
□ API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
□ Architecture decision records (ADRs)
□ Coding standards and conventions documented
□ Deployment and operational procedures
```

**Anti-pattern: Rushing Into AI**
Starting AI adoption without proper assessment leads to inconsistent practices, security vulnerabilities, and team frustration.

---

## Rules as Code

**Maturity**: Beginner  
**Description**: Treat AI coding standards like infrastructure - version them, evolve them, and make them explicit. Every AI session starts fresh, so without persistent rules, you're teaching AI your preferences from scratch each time.

**Related Patterns**: [AI Developer Lifecycle](#ai-developer-lifecycle), [AI Knowledge Persistence](#ai-knowledge-persistence)

**Standardized Project Structure**
```bash
project/
├── .ai/                          # AI configuration directory
│   ├── rules/                    # Modular rule sets
│   │   ├── security.md          # Security standards
│   │   ├── testing.md           # Testing requirements
│   │   ├── style.md             # Code style guide

└── .windsurf/                   # Windsurf configuration
    └── rules.md
```

**Anti-pattern: Context Drift**
Each developer maintains their own prompts and preferences, leading to inconsistent code across the team.

---

## AI Security Sandbox

**Maturity**: Beginner  
**Description**: Run AI tools in isolated environments that can't access secrets, credentials, or sensitive data. Essential for preventing credential leaks and maintaining security compliance.

**Related Patterns**: [AI Security & Compliance](#ai-security--compliance), [Rules as Code](#rules-as-code)

**Docker-Based Isolation**
```yaml
# docker-compose.ai-sandbox.yml
version: '3.8'

services:
  ai-development:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.ai-sandbox
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    cap_drop:
      - ALL
    volumes:
      # Read-only source code access
      - ./src:/workspace/src:ro
      - ./tests:/workspace/tests:rw
      # NO access to sensitive directories:
      # - .env files, .aws credentials, .ssh keys, secrets/ directory
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development
      - AI_SANDBOX=true
    networks:
      - ai-isolated
    restart: no

networks:
  ai-isolated:
    driver: bridge
    internal: true  # No external network access
```

**Anti-pattern: Unrestricted Access**
Allowing AI tools full system access risks credential leaks, data breaches, and security compliance violations.

---

## AI Developer Lifecycle

**Maturity**: Intermediate  
**Description**: AI development follows a structured lifecycle from problem definition through deployment, integrating all tactical patterns for systematic, testable, and maintainable AI-assisted development.

**Related Patterns**: [Rules as Code](#rules-as-code), [ATDD-Driven AI Development](#atdd-driven-ai-development), [Observable AI Development](#observable-ai-development)

**The Complete Lifecycle**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Problem Definition] --> B[Technical Plan]
    B --> C[Product Requirements]
    C --> D[User Stories]
    D --> E[Acceptance Tests]
    E --> F[Implementation]
    F --> G[Testing & Validation]
    G --> H[Deployment]
    H --> I[Monitoring]
    I --> J[Iteration]
    J --> A
```

**Anti-pattern: Ad-Hoc AI Development**
Jumping straight to coding with AI without proper planning, requirements, or testing strategy.

---

## AI Failure Recovery Protocol

**Maturity**: Intermediate  
**Description**: Systematic approach to detecting and recovering from AI-generated issues with automated rollback triggers and learning capture mechanisms.

**Detection & Recovery Framework**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Issue Detection] --> B{Severity Assessment}
    B -->|Critical| C[Immediate Rollback]
    B -->|High| D[Human Escalation]
    B -->|Medium| E[Automated Fix Attempt]
    B -->|Low| F[Log for Review]
    C --> G[Post-Incident Analysis]
    D --> G
    E --> H{Fix Successful?}
    H -->|No| D
    H -->|Yes| I[Update Knowledge Base]
    F --> I
    G --> I
```

**Anti-pattern: Ignore and Hope**
Ignoring AI-generated issues or assuming they'll resolve themselves leads to accumulated technical debt and system instability.

---

## Human-AI Handoff Protocol

**Maturity**: Intermediate  
**Description**: Clear boundaries and procedures for transitioning work between human developers and AI tools based on complexity, security requirements, and creative problem-solving needs.

**Handoff Decision Framework**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Task Assessment] --> B{Complexity Level}
    B -->|Low| C[AI First]
    B -->|Medium| D[AI with Human Review]
    B -->|High| E[Human First]
    B -->|Critical| F[Human Only]
    
    C --> G{Quality Check}
    D --> H{AI Success?}
    E --> I{Need AI Assistance?}
    F --> J[Human Implementation]
    
    G -->|Pass| K[Deploy]
    G -->|Fail| L[Human Review]
    H -->|Yes| M[Human Verification]
    H -->|No| N[Human Takeover]
    I -->|Yes| O[Collaborative Mode]
    I -->|No| J
```

**Anti-pattern: Unclear Boundaries**
Allowing AI and humans to work on the same task simultaneously without clear handoff points leads to conflicts, duplicated effort, and inconsistent quality.

---

# Development Patterns

Development patterns provide tactical approaches for day-to-day AI-assisted coding workflows, focusing on quality, maintainability, and team collaboration.

## ATDD-Driven AI Development

**Maturity**: Intermediate  
**Description**: Use Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD) to guide AI code generation by writing executable specifications first, then prompting AI to create minimal implementations that satisfy the acceptance criteria.

**Related Patterns**: [AI Developer Lifecycle](#ai-developer-lifecycle), [Comprehensive AI Testing Strategy](#comprehensive-ai-testing-strategy), [Observable AI Development](#observable-ai-development)

**The ATDD-AI Workflow**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Write Gherkin Feature] --> B[Generate Step Definitions with AI]
    B --> C[Prompt AI for Minimal Implementation]
    C --> D[Run Acceptance Tests]
    D --> E{Tests Pass?}
    E -->|No| F[Refine AI Prompts]
    F --> C
    E -->|Yes| G[Refactor with AI]
    G --> H[Verify Tests Still Pass]
    H --> I[Next Feature]
    I --> A
```

**Examples**

**Step 1: Write Executable Specifications First**
```gherkin
# features/user_authentication.feature
Feature: User Authentication
  As a user
  I want to log into the system
  So that I can access my personal dashboard

  Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
    Given a user exists with email "user@example.com" and password "securepass123"
    When I submit login credentials "user@example.com" and "securepass123"
    Then I should be redirected to the dashboard
    And I should see a welcome message "Welcome back!"

  Scenario: Failed login with invalid credentials
    Given a user exists with email "user@example.com" and password "securepass123"
    When I submit login credentials "user@example.com" and "wrongpassword"
    Then I should see an error message "Invalid credentials"
    And I should remain on the login page
```

**Step 2: AI-Generated Step Definitions**
```python
# features/steps/auth_steps.py
# Prompt: "Generate pytest-bdd step definitions for the user authentication feature"

from pytest_bdd import given, when, then, scenarios
from selenium import webdriver
import pytest

scenarios('../user_authentication.feature')

@given('a user exists with email "<email>" and password "<password>"')
def user_exists(email, password):
    # AI generates user creation logic
    user_service.create_user(email=email, password=password)

@when('I submit login credentials "<email>" and "<password>"')
def submit_login(browser, email, password):
    # AI generates form interaction
    browser.find_element_by_id("email").send_keys(email)
    browser.find_element_by_id("password").send_keys(password)
    browser.find_element_by_id("login-button").click()

@then('I should be redirected to the dashboard')
def verify_dashboard_redirect(browser):
    # AI generates assertion logic
    assert "/dashboard" in browser.current_url
```

**Anti-pattern: Implementation-First AI**
Writing code with AI first, then trying to retrofit tests, resulting in tests that mirror implementation rather than specify behavior.

---

## Comprehensive AI Testing Strategy

**Maturity**: Intermediate  
**Description**: Unified approach combining test-first development, automated test generation, and quality assurance patterns to ensure AI-generated code meets quality and behavioral specifications.

**Related Patterns**: [ATDD-Driven AI Development](#atdd-driven-ai-development), [Observable AI Development](#observable-ai-development)

**Integrated Testing Framework**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Acceptance Tests] --> B[Unit Test Generation]
    B --> C[Integration Tests]
    C --> D[Performance Tests]
    D --> E[Security Tests]
    E --> F[Flakiness Detection]
    F --> G[Quality Gates]
    G --> H{All Tests Pass?}
    H -->|Yes| I[Deploy]
    H -->|No| J[AI Test Refinement]
    J --> B
```

**Anti-pattern: Test Generation Without Strategy**
Generating tests with AI without a coherent strategy leads to poor coverage, flaky tests, and false confidence in code quality.

---

## Progressive AI Enhancement

**Maturity**: Beginner  
**Description**: Build complex features through small, deployable iterations. Each AI interaction adds one specific enhancement rather than trying to build everything at once.

**Related Patterns**: [AI Developer Lifecycle](#ai-developer-lifecycle), [Constraint-Based AI Development](#constraint-based-ai-development)

**Examples**
Building authentication progressively:
```bash
# Day 1: Minimal login
"Create POST /login that returns 200 for admin/admin, 401 otherwise"
→ Deploy

# Day 2: Real password check
"Modify login to check passwords against users table. Keep existing API."
→ Deploy

# Day 3: Add security
"Add bcrypt hashing to login. Support both hashed and plain passwords temporarily."
→ Deploy

# Day 4: Modern tokens
"Replace session with JWT. Keep session endpoint for backward compatibility."
→ Deploy
```

**Anti-pattern: Big Bang Generation**
Asking AI to "create a complete user management system" results in 5000 lines of coupled, untested code that takes days to review and debug.

---

## AI Workflow Orchestration

**Maturity**: Advanced  
**Description**: Coordinate sequential pipelines, parallel workflows, and hybrid human-AI processes for complex development tasks requiring multiple AI tools and human oversight.

**Related Patterns**: [Human-AI Handoff Protocol](#human-ai-handoff-protocol), [Comprehensive AI Testing Strategy](#comprehensive-ai-testing-strategy)

**Workflow Types & Selection**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Task Analysis] --> B{Workflow Type}
    B -->|Sequential| C[Pipeline Workflow]
    B -->|Parallel| D[Multi-Agent Workflow]
    B -->|Complex| E[Hybrid Workflow]
    
    C --> F[Stage 1: Generate]
    F --> G[Stage 2: Review]
    G --> H[Stage 3: Optimize]
    H --> I[Stage 4: Test]
    
    D --> J[Agent 1: Backend]
    D --> K[Agent 2: Frontend]
    D --> L[Agent 3: Tests]
    J --> M[Synchronization]
    K --> M
    L --> M
    
    E --> N[Human Planning]
    N --> O[AI Implementation]
    O --> P[Human Review]
    P --> Q[AI Refinement]
```

**Anti-pattern: Uncoordinated Multi-Tool Usage**
Using multiple AI tools without proper orchestration leads to inconsistent code, integration conflicts, and wasted effort from competing implementations.

---

## Context Window Optimization

**Maturity**: Intermediate  
**Description**: Match AI tool selection to task complexity and optimize cost/performance trade-offs. Using Claude for every task is like using a sledgehammer to hang a picture.

**Related Patterns**: [Progressive AI Enhancement](#progressive-ai-enhancement), [AI Workflow Orchestration](#ai-workflow-orchestration)

**Decision Matrix**
```
Task: Add null check
Tool: GitHub Copilot (instant, cheap)
Context: <100 tokens

Task: Extract method
Tool: Cursor Cmd+K (fast, focused)  
Context: <1000 tokens

Task: Refactor module
Tool: Windsurf Cascade (handles dependencies)
Context: <10000 tokens

Task: Design architecture
Tool: Claude Code (best reasoning)
Context: Full codebase
```

---

## AI Knowledge Persistence

**Maturity**: Intermediate  
**Description**: Capture successful patterns and failed attempts as versioned knowledge for future sessions.

**Related Patterns**: [Rules as Code](#rules-as-code), [AI Failure Recovery Protocol](#ai-failure-recovery-protocol)

**Examples**
`.ai/knowledge/authentication.md`:
```markdown
## Successful Patterns

### JWT Implementation
Prompt that works 95% of the time:
"Implement JWT auth:
- RS256 algorithm (never HS256)
- 15 min access token
- 7 day refresh token in httpOnly cookie
- Include user.id and role in payload"

## Failed Patterns

### ❌ "Make authentication secure"
Too vague - AI adds unnecessary complexity

## Gotchas
- AI defaults to HS256 (insecure)
- Often uses deprecated bcrypt methods
```

---

## Constraint-Based AI Development

**Maturity**: Beginner  
**Description**: Give AI specific constraints to prevent over-engineering and ensure focused solutions.

**Related Patterns**: [Progressive AI Enhancement](#progressive-ai-enhancement), [Human-AI Handoff Protocol](#human-ai-handoff-protocol)

**Examples**
```
Bad: "Create user service"
Good: "Create user service: <100 lines, 3 methods max, only bcrypt dependency"

Bad: "Add caching"
Good: "Add caching using Map, max 1000 entries, LRU eviction"

Bad: "Improve performance"
Good: "Reduce p99 latency to <50ms without new dependencies"
```

---

## Observable AI Development

**Maturity**: Intermediate  
**Description**: Make your system's behavior visible to AI through strategic logging and debugging. AI can't fix what it can't see.

**Related Patterns**: [AI Developer Lifecycle](#ai-developer-lifecycle), [Comprehensive AI Testing Strategy](#comprehensive-ai-testing-strategy)

**Examples**
```python
# Good: Observable operations
import logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def process_order(order):
    logger.info(f"[ORDER] Processing {order.id} for {order.customer_email}")
    
    try:
        logger.info("[ORDER] Validating...")
        validate_order(order)
        logger.info("[ORDER] ✓ Validation passed")
        
        logger.info(f"[PAYMENT] Charging ${order.total} via {order.payment_method}")
        result = charge_payment(order)
        logger.info(f"[PAYMENT] ✓ Transaction: {result.transaction_id}")
        
    except ValidationError as e:
        logger.error(f"[ORDER] ✗ Validation failed: {e.field} - {e.message}")
        raise
```

**Anti-pattern: Black Box Systems**
Minimal or cryptic logging that leaves AI guessing about system state and failure causes.

---

# Operations Patterns

Operations patterns focus on CI/CD, security, compliance, and production management with AI assistance, building on the foundation and development patterns.

## AI Security & Compliance

**Maturity**: Advanced  
**Description**: Unified framework for policy generation, vulnerability scanning, and compliance automation using AI to transform regulatory requirements into executable code.

**Related Patterns**: [AI Security Sandbox](#ai-security-sandbox), [Rules as Code](#rules-as-code)

**Unified Security Framework**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Compliance Requirements] --> B[AI Policy Generation]
    B --> C[Vulnerability Scanning]
    C --> D[Security Testing]
    D --> E[Compliance Evidence]
    E --> F[Audit Reports]
    F --> G[Continuous Monitoring]
    G --> H[Policy Updates]
    H --> B
```

**Policy-as-Code Generation**
```bash
# policies/req.md
"Data at rest must be AES-256 encrypted in transit and at rest per SOC 2."

# Generate policy
ai "Convert policies/req.md into Cedar policy code" > policies/code/encryption.cedar
opa test policies/code/encryption.cedar
```

**Security Scanning Orchestration**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
snyk test --json > snyk.json
bandit -r src -f json > bandit.json
trivy fs --format json . > trivy.json
ai "Summarize snyk.json, bandit.json, trivy.json; list CRITICAL issues" > pr-comment.txt
gh pr comment --body-file pr-comment.txt
if grep -q '"severity":"CRITICAL"' pr-comment.txt; then exit 1; fi
```

**Anti-pattern: Fragmented Security**
Implementing security tools and compliance checks in isolation without a unified AI-driven framework leads to gaps and inconsistencies.

---

## Deployment Automation

**Maturity**: Advanced  
**Description**: AI-powered pipeline generation, blue-green deployments, and intelligent rollback strategies that adapt to system behavior and historical patterns.

**Related Patterns**: [AI Workflow Orchestration](#ai-workflow-orchestration), [Observable AI Development](#observable-ai-development)

**Pipeline Synthesis**
```bash
# ci.spec
install dependencies -> pip install -r requirements.txt
run tests -> pytest
build image -> docker build -t myapp .
push image -> aws ecr get-login-password | docker push myapp:latest

# Generate CI
ai "Read ci.spec and output GitHub Actions YAML" > .github/workflows/ci.yml
git add ci.spec .github/workflows/ci.yml
git commit -m "chore: generate CI from spec"
```

**Intelligent Rollback Strategies**
```bash
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics --output text > metrics.csv
ai "From metrics.csv, suggest a 5% canary rollout and rollback criteria" > canary.json
deploy-tool update-release --config canary.json
```

**Anti-pattern: Static Deployment**
Using fixed deployment scripts without AI adaptation leads to suboptimal rollout strategies and missed opportunities for intelligent automation.

---

## Monitoring & Maintenance

**Maturity**: Advanced  
**Description**: Performance baselines, incident response, and technical debt management with AI assistance for proactive system health and automated maintenance workflows.

**Related Patterns**: [Observable AI Development](#observable-ai-development), [AI Knowledge Persistence](#ai-knowledge-persistence)

**Performance Baseline Management**
```bash
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics --period 86400 > perf.csv
ai "From perf.csv, recommend latency alert thresholds and autoscale policies" > perf-policy.json
deploy-tool apply perf-policy.json
```

**Technical Debt Forecasting**
```bash
cloc src > loc.txt
coverage run -m pytest; coverage report > cov.txt
ai "From loc.txt and cov.txt, list top-3 files needing refactor and tests" > debt.txt
```

**Incident Response Automation**
```bash
pd incidents:list --limit 10 > incidents.json
ai "Create a step-by-step RDS failover runbook from incidents.json" > runbooks/rds-failover.md
git add runbooks/rds-failover.md
```

**Anti-pattern: Reactive Maintenance**
Waiting for incidents to spike forces firefighting rather than proactive system health management with AI assistance.

---

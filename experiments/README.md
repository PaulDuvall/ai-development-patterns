## Advanced Workflows

### Human-AI Handoff Protocol

**Maturity**: Intermediate  
**Description**: Clear boundaries and procedures for transitioning work between human developers and AI tools based on complexity, security requirements, and creative problem-solving needs.

**Related Patterns**: [AI Developer Lifecycle](../README.md#ai-developer-lifecycle), [Observable AI Development](../README.md#observable-ai-development), [AI Workflow Orchestration](#ai-workflow-orchestration)

**Handoff Decision Framework**

    H -->|Yes| M[Human Verification]
    H -->|No| N[Human Takeover]
    I -->|Yes| O[Collaborative Mode]
    I -->|No| J
```

**Handoff Execution Sequence**

```mermaid

    end
    
    Note over H,R: Continuous Learning

```

**Anti-pattern: Unclear Boundaries**
Allowing AI and humans to work on the same task simultaneously without clear handoff points leads to conflicts, duplicated effort, and inconsistent quality.

---

### Comprehensive AI Testing Strategy

**Maturity**: Intermediate  
**Description**: Unified approach combining test-first development, automated test generation, and quality assurance patterns to ensure AI-generated code meets quality and behavioral specifications.

**Pattern Boundary Clarification**:
- **This pattern** focuses on overall testing strategy and test generation
- **Specification Driven Development** focuses on writing specs before implementation
- **Observable AI Development** focuses on logging and debugging for AI understanding
- **AI-Driven Traceability** focuses on linking requirements to tests and implementation

**Related Patterns**: [Specification Driven Development](../README.md#specification-driven-development), [Observable AI Development](../README.md#observable-ai-development)

**Anti-pattern: Test Generation Without Strategy**
Generating tests with AI without a coherent strategy leads to poor coverage, flaky tests, and false confidence in code quality.

### AI Workflow Orchestration

**Maturity**: Advanced  
**Description**: Coordinate sequential pipelines, parallel agent workflows, and hybrid human-AI processes for complex development tasks. Transform synchronous single-agent workflows into asynchronous, event-driven multi-agent architectures while maintaining safety and consistency.

**Related Patterns**: [Human-AI Handoff Protocol](#human-ai-handoff-protocol), [AI Tool Integration](../README.md#ai-tool-integration), [Comprehensive AI Testing Strategy](#comprehensive-ai-testing-strategy), [Atomic Task Decomposition](../README.md#atomic-task-decomposition)

**Workflow Types & Selection**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Task Analysis] --> B{Workflow Type}
    B -->|Sequential| C[Pipeline Workflow]

    C->>R: Trigger Integration Review
    R->>R: Analyze Outputs for Conflicts
    alt No Conflicts Detected
        R->>O: Integration Approved
        O->>H: Ready for Human Review
    else Conflicts Found
        R->>O: Conflict Report (API mismatch)
        O->>A1: Resolve API Contract Issue
        A1->>C: Resolution Complete
        C->>R: Re-trigger Review
        R->>O: Integration Approved
    end
    
    Note over O,H: Final Integration
    H->>O: Approve Integration
    O->>C: Merge All Components
    C->>H: Feature Complete
```

**Parallel Agent Coordination Examples**

```bash
# Atomic task breakdown for parallel execution
ai_task_manager "Break down user authentication feature into atomic tasks:
- Each task <2 hours completion time
- Independent implementation (no shared state)
- Clear input/output contracts
- Parallelizable across agents"

# Parallel agent execution with safety
ai_orchestrator --parallel --safe-mode \
  --task="backend-auth-api" --agent="backend-specialist" \
  --task="frontend-login-ui" --agent="frontend-specialist" \
  --task="integration-tests" --agent="testing-specialist" \
  --sync-point="integration-review"

# Safety-first parallel review
ai_reviewer --parallel-output \
  --check-conflicts \
  --verify-contracts \
  --merge-strategy="human-approval"
```

**Parallel Agent Safety Framework**

```yaml
# .ai/parallel-config.yml
parallel_safety:
  max_concurrent_agents: 3
  conflict_detection: enabled
  shared_resources:
    - "src/shared/"
    - "package.json"
    - "database/migrations/"
  isolation_boundaries:
    - backend: "src/api/"
    - frontend: "src/components/"
    - testing: "tests/"
  sync_points:
    - after_implementation
    - before_integration
    - before_deployment
```

**Anti-pattern: Uncoordinated Multi-Tool Usage**
Using multiple AI tools without proper orchestration leads to inconsistent code, integration conflicts, and wasted effort from competing implementations.

**Anti-pattern: Unsafe Parallel Execution**
Running parallel agents without proper isolation, conflict detection, or sync points risks data corruption, merge conflicts, and system instability.

### Context Window Optimization

**Maturity**: Advanced  
**Description**: Match AI tool selection to task complexity and optimize cost/performance trade-offs by understanding different AI models' context window capabilities and computational costs.

**Related Patterns**: [Progressive AI Enhancement](../README.md#progressive-ai-enhancement), [AI Choice Generation](../README.md#ai-choice-generation)

**Tool Selection Decision Matrix**

| Task Complexity | Context Needed | Recommended Tool | Cost Level | Use Case |
|-----------------|----------------|------------------|------------|----------|
| Simple queries | <1K tokens | GPT-3.5, Claude Haiku | Low | Quick questions, simple code |
| Medium features | 1K-8K tokens | GPT-4, Claude Sonnet | Medium | Feature implementation |
| Complex systems | 8K-32K tokens | GPT-4 Turbo, Claude Opus | High | Architecture, large refactors |
| Massive codebases | 32K+ tokens | Claude-100K, GPT-4-128K | Premium | Full system analysis |

**Anti-pattern: One-Size-Fits-All**
Always using the most powerful (expensive) AI model for simple tasks wastes resources and increases latency for routine operations.

---

### Visual Context Scaffolding

**Maturity**: Intermediate  
**Description**: Upload images (diagrams, mockups, flows) as primary specifications for AI coding tools to build accurate implementations from visual context.

**Related Patterns**: [Specification Driven Development](../README.md#specification-driven-development), [Progressive AI Enhancement](../README.md#progressive-ai-enhancement), [Context Window Optimization](#context-window-optimization)

#### Core Implementation

```bash
# 1. Prepare visual specifications
# Create architecture diagram showing microservices structure
# Save as: architecture.png with labeled components:
# - API Gateway (port 8080)
# - User Service (port 3001)
# - Order Service (port 3002)  
# - Payment Service (port 3003)
# - PostgreSQL databases per service
# - RabbitMQ message bus connections

# 2. Upload to AI coding tool with minimal context
# Example prompt for Claude Code:
cat > build-request.txt << 'EOF'
Build this microservices architecture from the attached diagram.
Tech stack: Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ
Start with the User Service following the exact structure shown.
Include health check endpoints at /health for each service.
EOF

# 3. Iterate with visual feedback
# After initial generation, screenshot the running system
# Annotate screenshot with required changes
# Example: mark missing authentication flow in red
# Re-upload annotated screenshot with refinement request

# 4. Structure for complex UIs
# For dashboard implementation:
# - dashboard-layout.png (grid measurements, component names)
# - dashboard-interactions.png (click flows, state changes)
# - data-model.png (API responses, field mappings)

# Upload sequence with prompt:
"Implement this dashboard using React and Tailwind.
Match the layout from dashboard-layout.png exactly.
Use the interaction flows from dashboard-interactions.png.
Mock data structure should follow data-model.png."
```

#### Anti-pattern: Kitchen Sink Upload

**Problem**: Uploading many diagrams at once (e.g., 15+) without structure or context

```bash
# Wrong approach - overwhelming context
"Here are all my diagrams. Build the system."
# Uploads: erd.png, architecture.png, flow1.png, flow2.png, 
# ui1.png, ui2.png, deployment.png, sequence1.png...

# Why it fails:
# - AI loses focus trying to parse everything
# - Contradictions between diagrams cause confusion
# - Exceeds useful context window
# - No clear starting point

# Correct approach:
# Upload progressively with clear hierarchy
"1. Start with this high-level architecture (architecture.png)
2. Focus on User Service first
3. I'll provide UI mockups after core services work"
```

### AI Event Automation

**Maturity**: Intermediate
**Description**: Execute custom commands automatically at specific lifecycle events (before/after file operations, session start, prompt submission) for workflow automation, validation, and policy enforcement.

**Related Patterns**: [Rules as Code](../README.md#rules-as-code), [AI Security Sandbox](../README.md#ai-security-sandbox)

**Core Concept**

Attach shell commands to AI assistant lifecycle events. Commands receive context via environment variables (file paths, tool names, user prompts) and return exit codes: `0` (allow), `2` (block), or other (warn).

**Event Flow Example**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Dev as Developer
    participant AI as AI Assistant
    participant Pre as PreToolUse Hook
    participant Post as PostToolUse Hook

    Dev->>AI: Edit .env file
    AI->>Pre: Run security-hook.sh
    Pre->>Pre: Check if file is sensitive
    Pre-->>AI: Exit 2 (BLOCK)
    AI->>Dev: ❌ Blocked: Cannot edit sensitive file

    Dev->>AI: Edit src/api.js
    AI->>Pre: Run security-hook.sh
    Pre->>Pre: Check if file is sensitive
    Pre-->>AI: Exit 0 (Allow)
    AI->>AI: Execute file edit
    AI->>Post: Run security-hook.sh
    Post->>Post: Scan for secrets with gitleaks
    alt Secret Found
        Post-->>AI: Exit 1 (Warning)
        AI->>Dev: ⚠️ Secret detected! Review before committing
    else No Secret
        Post-->>AI: Exit 0 (Success)
        AI->>Dev: ✅ Edit complete
    end
```

**Simple Security Example**

Prevent editing sensitive files and scan for secrets:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# security-hook.sh

FILE="$TOOL_INPUT_FILE_PATH"

# Block .env and credentials files
if echo "$FILE" | grep -E "(\.env|secrets\.json|credentials)" > /dev/null; then
  echo "❌ Blocked: Cannot edit sensitive file"
  exit 2
fi

# Scan for hardcoded secrets (requires gitleaks)
if command -v gitleaks > /dev/null; then
  if gitleaks detect --no-git --source="$FILE" 2>&1 | grep -q "leaks found"; then
    echo "⚠️ Secret detected! Review before committing."
    exit 1
  fi
fi

exit 0
```

**Configuration Example (Claude Code)**

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "Edit",
      "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "./security-hook.sh"}]
    }],
    "PostToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "Edit",
      "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "./security-hook.sh"}]
    }]
  }
}
```

**Common Use Cases**
- Auto-format code after edits (`prettier`, `black`, `gofmt`)
- Block sensitive file modifications
- Log AI interactions for compliance
- Run linters before commits

**Security Warning**

Event commands run with full system access. Always review scripts before enabling. Test in isolated environments first.

**Complete Example**

See [examples/ai-event-automation/](examples/ai-event-automation/) for working implementation with security scanning and slash command integration.

**Anti-pattern: Unchecked Event Commands**

Running automation from untrusted sources without review exposes your system to malicious code execution and credential theft. Always audit event scripts before installation.

---

### Custom AI Commands

**Maturity**: Intermediate
**Description**: Discover and use built-in command vocabularies, then extend them with custom commands that encode domain expertise and sophisticated workflows.

**Related Patterns**: [AI Event Automation](#ai-event-automation), [Specification Driven Development](../README.md#specification-driven-development), [Rules as Code](../README.md#rules-as-code)

**Core Concept**

AI coding tools provide built-in commands for common operations and support custom commands (markdown files with AI instructions) for project-specific workflows. Commands are manual/on-demand (invoked like `/refactor`), while events fire automatically (see [AI Event Automation](#ai-event-automation)).

**Command Discovery**

Discover built-in commands first:

```bash
# Claude Code
/help /model /clear /review

# Cursor IDE
Cmd+K /edit /chat

# Gemini CLI
/stats /memory /tools /clear
```

| Use Built-in Commands | Create Custom Commands |
|-----------------------|------------------------|
| Generic operations (clear, help, model) | Domain expertise (refactoring, security analysis) |
| Tool features (review, edit) | Project workflows (deploy, implement-spec) |
| Universal commands | Team standards and conventions |

**Example: Refactoring Assistant**

Encode Martin Fowler's refactoring catalog for systematic code improvement:

```markdown
# .claude/commands/refactor.md
Interactive refactoring assistant based on Martin Fowler's refactoring catalog.

## Usage
/refactor              # Full analysis
/refactor --smell      # Code smells only

## Implementation

### 1. Code Smell Detection
- Long methods (>20 lines), duplicate code, complex conditionals
- For each: location (file:line), severity, specific refactoring, effort estimate

### 2. Bloater Detection
- Excessive parameters (>4), data clumps, primitive obsession

### 3. Refactoring Strategy
1. Name the code smell
2. Recommend technique from Fowler's catalog
3. Show before/after example
4. Estimate maintainability improvement

Generate step-by-step refactoring plan prioritized by impact.
```

**More Examples**

Additional command examples with detailed implementations:

- **[Implement-Spec](examples/custom-ai-commands/implement-spec-example.md)** - Spec-driven implementation with TDD and traceability
- **[Security Review](examples/custom-ai-commands/security-review-example.md)** - Multi-layer security analysis (secrets, vulnerabilities, config)
- **[Safe-Refactor](examples/custom-ai-commands/safe-refactor-example.md)** - Safe refactoring with automated testing and rollback
- **[Test Runner](examples/custom-ai-commands/test-example.md)** - Smart test selection with coverage and health monitoring

**Tool Support**

```bash
# Claude Code: .claude/commands/*.md
mkdir -p .claude/commands
cp commands/refactor.md .claude/commands/

# Cursor IDE: .cursorrules
cat commands/refactor.md >> .cursorrules

# Generic: .ai/commands/ (tool-agnostic)
mkdir -p .ai/commands
```

**Complete Implementation**

See [examples/custom-ai-commands/](examples/custom-ai-commands/) for ready-to-use commands, configuration files, and setup guide.

**Anti-pattern: Ignoring Built-in Commands**

Creating `/clear` when the tool already provides it. Always discover built-in commands first.

**Anti-pattern: Shallow Commands**

```markdown
# Bad: Just wraps shell command
Run: npm run deploy:staging

# Good: Encodes expertise
1. Verify staging environment health
2. Check for active incidents
3. Review recent commits for risk
4. Run deployment with rollback plan
```

**Anti-pattern: Hardcoded Context**

```markdown
# Bad: Hardcoded values
Deploy to prod-db-instance-1.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com

# Good: Parameterized
Deploy to database: $1 (default: $STAGING_DB)
```

1. File conflicts (same files modified by multiple agents)
2. API contract mismatches (function signatures, return types)
3. Dependency version conflicts
4. Naming collisions (classes, functions, variables)
5. Integration compatibility issues

For each conflict found:
- Identify which agents are involved
- Assess conflict severity (critical/medium/low)
- Suggest resolution strategy
- Generate merge commands when possible

Output structured JSON with conflicts and resolutions."

Quality checks:
- Syntax validation (python -m py_compile)
- Type checking (mypy)
- Security scan (bandit)
- Test coverage (>80% requirement)
- Performance regression check

Generate integration tests that:
- Import all agent outputs without conflicts
- Test cross-agent functionality
- Verify API compatibility
- Check end-to-end workflows

Return pass/fail status with specific issues found."

### Technical Debt Forecasting

**Maturity**: Intermediate  
**Description**: Proactively identify and prioritize technical debt using AI-powered code analysis.

**Related Patterns**: [AI-Driven Refactoring](../README.md#ai-driven-refactoring), [AI-Driven Architecture Design](../README.md#ai-driven-architecture-design), [AI Tool Integration](../README.md#ai-tool-integration)

```bash
ai "Analyze codebase for technical debt indicators and forecast maintenance burden:
1. Code complexity hotspots
2. Cyclomatic complexity trends  
3. Dependency staleness
4. Test coverage gaps
5. Documentation drift
Prioritize by maintenance cost and business impact."
```

**Anti-pattern: Reactive Debt Management**
Waiting until technical debt becomes a crisis instead of continuously monitoring and addressing it through predictive analysis.

---

### Pipeline Synthesis

**Maturity**: Intermediate  
**Description**: Convert plain-English build specifications into CI/CD pipeline configurations.

**Related Patterns**: [AI Workflow Orchestration](#ai-workflow-orchestration), [AI Tool Integration](../README.md#ai-tool-integration)

```bash
ai "Generate GitHub Actions workflow from specification:
Build Requirements:
- Node.js 18 with npm ci
- Run tests with jest
- Deploy to AWS on main branch push
- Require test coverage >80%

Output complete .github/workflows/ci.yml with security best practices."
```

**Anti-pattern: Manual Pipeline Maintenance**
Hand-crafting and updating CI/CD configurations instead of generating them from requirements specifications leads to inconsistency and maintenance burden.

---

### AI-Guided Blue-Green Deployment

**Maturity**: Advanced  
**Description**: Generate blue-green deployment scripts with validation to prevent AI misconceptions about deployment strategies.

**Related Patterns**: [Pipeline Synthesis](#pipeline-synthesis)

**Important**: AI tools often confuse blue-green with canary deployments. Blue-green requires full environment duplication and instant traffic switching.

```yaml
# blue-green-deploy.yml - Full environment switch pattern
deployment_strategy: "blue-green"
traffic_routing:
  method: "dns_switch"  # Instant 100% traffic switch
  rollback_time: "< 30 seconds"
environments:
  blue:
    infrastructure: "complete duplicate"
    traffic_percentage: "100% OR 0%"  # Never split
  green:
    infrastructure: "complete duplicate" 
    traffic_percentage: "0% OR 100%"  # Never split
validation:
  health_checks: ["api_health", "database_connection"]
  smoke_tests: ["critical_user_flows"]
  approval_required: true
```

**Anti-pattern: Blue-Green-Canary Confusion**
AI-generated deployment scripts that mix blue-green and canary strategies, resulting in complex traffic splitting instead of simple environment switching.

2. Generate corrective Terraform plan
3. Assess drift risk level (critical/medium/low)
4. Create automated remediation script with approval gates"
```

**Anti-pattern: Manual Drift Checking**
Relying on periodic manual infrastructure audits instead of continuous automated drift detection and remediation.

---

### Release Note Synthesis

**Maturity**: Beginner  
**Description**: Automatically generate structured release notes by analyzing git commit history.

**Related Patterns**: [Pipeline Synthesis](#pipeline-synthesis)

```bash
ai "Generate release notes from git log --since='2 weeks ago':
Format:

3. Generate test stabilization patches
4. Recommend test suite restructuring"
```

**Anti-pattern: Ignoring Flaky Tests**
Accepting unreliable tests as normal instead of systematically identifying and fixing test suite stability issues.

---

### Dependency Upgrade Advisor

**Maturity**: Intermediate  
**Description**: Intelligently manage dependency upgrades with compatibility analysis and risk assessment.

**Related Patterns**: [Technical Debt Forecasting](#technical-debt-forecasting)

```bash
ai "Analyze package.json/requirements.txt for upgrade opportunities:
1. Check security vulnerabilities (npm audit, safety)
2. Assess breaking change risk
3. Generate staged upgrade plan
4. Create rollback procedures"
```

**Anti-pattern: Batch Upgrades**
Upgrading all dependencies simultaneously without risk assessment or staged rollout plans.

/vulnerability-check [package] - Check specific dependency
/compliance-status [environment] - Check policy compliance
Include results formatting and alert escalation."
```

**Anti-pattern: Delayed Security Feedback**
Waiting for scheduled security scans instead of enabling on-demand security validation through developer workflows.

---

### Compliance Evidence Automation

**Maturity**: Advanced  
**Description**: Generate audit evidence matrices from logs and configuration changes automatically.

**Related Patterns**: [Security Scanning Orchestration](../README.md#security-scanning-orchestration)

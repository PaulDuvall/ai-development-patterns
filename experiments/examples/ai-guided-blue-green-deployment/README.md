# AI-Guided Blue-Green Deployment Implementation

This directory contains a complete implementation of the AI-Guided Blue-Green Deployment pattern, generating blue-green deployment scripts with validation to prevent AI misconceptions about deployment strategies.

## Overview

AI-Guided Blue-Green Deployment enables teams to:
- Generate accurate blue-green deployment configurations using AI
- Ensure proper atomic traffic switching (not gradual like canary)
- Maintain two identical production environments
- Implement instant rollback capabilities

## Files in this Implementation

- `blue_green_deployment.md` - Complete blue-green deployment pattern documentation
- `deployment_templates/` - Infrastructure templates for blue-green environments
- `traffic_switching/` - Load balancer and DNS switching configurations
- `validation_scripts/` - Health check and smoke test implementations
- `rollback_procedures/` - Automated rollback and recovery scripts

## Key Distinction: Blue-Green vs Canary

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: This is NOT canary deployment. Key differences:

**Blue-Green Deployment:**
- Two identical environments (100% capacity each)
- Instant 100% traffic switch
- No gradual rollout
- Simple rollback by switching back

**Canary Deployment (NOT this pattern):**
- Single environment with gradual traffic shifting
- Percentage-based rollout (5%, 25%, 50%, 100%)
- Complex rollback procedures

## Quick Start

```bash
# Generate blue-green deployment configuration
ai "Create blue-green deployment for microservice with:
- Two identical Kubernetes environments
- Instant traffic switch via ingress
- Health checks and validation
- Rollback procedures"

# Deploy to green environment
./deploy-to-green.sh

# Switch traffic atomically
./switch-traffic.sh blue-to-green

# Rollback if needed
./rollback.sh green-to-blue
```

**Complete Implementation**: This directory contains the full blue-green deployment system with AI-generated configurations, validation procedures, and atomic traffic switching mechanisms.

## Getting Started

1. Review stable prerequisites in the main catalog:
   - [Security Sandbox](../../README.md#security-sandbox)
   - [Tool Integration](../../README.md#tool-integration)
   - [Spec-Driven Development](../../README.md#spec-driven-development)
2. Pick an experimental example directory from the table above.
3. Follow the `README.md` in that directory.

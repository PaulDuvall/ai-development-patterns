# Golden Test Protection via CODEOWNERS
#
# This is the PRIMARY enforcement mechanism for immutable golden tests.
# File permissions (444) and AI hooks provide defense-in-depth but can be
# bypassed by AI using bash commands like chmod.
#
# CODEOWNERS ensures that ANY modification to tests/golden/** requires
# explicit human approval, regardless of how the change was made.

# Golden tests require approval from tech leads and QA leads
tests/golden/**  @tech-leads @qa-leads

# Promotion workflow changes also require approval
scripts/promote-test.sh  @tech-leads

# Note: Replace @tech-leads and @qa-leads with actual GitHub team names
# or individual usernames (e.g., @alice @bob)

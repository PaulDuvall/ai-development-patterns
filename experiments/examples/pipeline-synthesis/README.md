# Pipeline Synthesis Implementation

This directory contains a complete implementation of the Pipeline Synthesis pattern, converting plain-English build specifications into CI/CD pipeline configurations.

## Overview

Pipeline Synthesis enables teams to:
- Convert natural language specifications into executable CI/CD pipelines
- Generate platform-specific configurations (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins)
- Maintain consistent pipeline standards across projects
- Automate pipeline updates when requirements change

## Files in this Implementation

- `ci_spec.md` - Complete pipeline synthesis pattern documentation and specifications
- `generators/` - AI-powered pipeline configuration generators
- `templates/` - Reusable pipeline templates for different platforms
- `validators/` - Pipeline configuration validation and testing tools
- `examples/` - Sample specifications and generated pipeline configurations

## Supported CI/CD Platforms

### GitHub Actions
- Workflow YAML generation
- Matrix builds and parallel jobs
- Secret management integration
- Artifact handling and deployment

### GitLab CI
- `.gitlab-ci.yml` configuration
- Pipeline stages and dependencies
- Docker integration and caching
- Environment-specific deployments

### Jenkins
- Jenkinsfile generation (declarative and scripted)
- Pipeline as Code
- Plugin integration and configuration
- Distributed builds

## Quick Start

```bash
# Create pipeline specification
cat > pipeline-spec.md << EOF
## Build Requirements
- Node.js 18 with npm ci
- Run tests with jest coverage >80%
- Security scan with npm audit
- Deploy to AWS on main branch push
- Slack notifications on failure
EOF

# Generate pipeline configuration
ai "Generate GitHub Actions workflow from specification in pipeline-spec.md:
- Include all specified requirements
- Use security best practices
- Add proper error handling
- Enable caching for performance"

# Validate generated pipeline
./validate-pipeline.sh --platform github-actions --file .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

**Complete Implementation**: This directory contains the full pipeline synthesis system with multi-platform support, specification validation, and automated pipeline generation capabilities.

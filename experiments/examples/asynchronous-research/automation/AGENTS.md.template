# Agent Guidance (Template)

## Research Standards
- Create one folder per research task.
- Include `prompt.md` (what you were asked) and `README.md` (what you found).
- Prefer runnable experiments and reproducible commands.

## Output Expectations
- Summarize the key conclusion first.
- Include raw data artifacts when you benchmark (JSON/CSV).
- Note limitations and follow-up questions.

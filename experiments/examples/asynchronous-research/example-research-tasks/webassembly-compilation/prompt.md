# WebAssembly Compilation Feasibility (Prompt)

```text
Work in new folder: webassembly-compilation/

Goal:
Prove whether a small C extension can be compiled for a Python WebAssembly runtime (e.g., Pyodide).

Deliverables:
- proof-of-concept build steps
- a minimal validation script
- README.md describing what worked and what didn't
```

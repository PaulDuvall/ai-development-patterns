# Technical Debt Analysis and Forecasting

## Overview
AI-powered technical debt identification, prioritization, and remediation strategies based on code analysis and development patterns.

## Debt Detection Framework

### Code Quality Metrics
```yaml
quality_metrics:
  code_smells:
    - metric: cyclomatic_complexity
      threshold: 10
      weight: 0.8
      tools: [radon, sonarqube]
      
    - metric: function_length
      threshold: 50  # lines
      weight: 0.6
      tools: [flake8, pylint]
      
    - metric: class_coupling
      threshold: 10  # dependencies
      weight: 0.7
      tools: [sonarqube, codeclimate]
      
    - metric: code_duplication
      threshold: 5  # percentage
      weight: 0.9
      tools: [jscpd, sonarqube]
      
  test_coverage:
    - metric: line_coverage
      threshold: 80
      weight: 0.7
      
    - metric: branch_coverage

cat duplication.json | jq '.statistics.total.percentage'

# Test coverage gaps
echo -e "\n--- Coverage Analysis ---"
coverage run -m pytest
coverage report --show-missing | grep -E "TOTAL|<80%"

# Dependency analysis
echo -e "\n--- Dependency Health ---"
pip list --outdated --format json > outdated_deps.json

## Debt Impact Analysis

### Business Impact Calculator
```python
# debt_impact.py
def calculate_debt_impact(debt_item):
    """Calculate business impact of technical debt"""
    
    # Development velocity impact
    velocity_impact = debt_item['added_time_percentage'] * team_velocity
    
    # Bug generation rate
    bug_rate = debt_item['complexity'] * 0.1  # 10% per complexity point
    
    # Customer impact
    if debt_item['affects_ux']:
        customer_impact = debt_item['affected_users'] * churn_risk
    else:
        customer_impact = 0
    
    # Security risk
    security_risk = debt_item['security_score'] * breach_cost_estimate
    
    # Total impact (dollars)
    total_impact = (
        velocity_impact * developer_cost_per_hour +
        bug_rate * average_bug_fix_cost +
        customer_impact * customer_lifetime_value +
        security_risk
    )
    
    return {
        'total_impact': total_impact,
        'monthly_cost': total_impact / 12,
        'fix_roi': total_impact / debt_item['fix_estimate_hours']
    }
```

### AI-Powered Prioritization
```bash
ai "Analyze technical debt items with business context:

Debt items: debt_items.json
Business metrics:
- Developer cost: $150/hour
- Customer LTV: $10,000
- Monthly revenue: $1M
- Team size: 10 developers

For each debt item, calculate:
1. Business impact in dollars
2. Fix effort in person-days
3. Risk if not addressed
4. Dependencies on other fixes

Output prioritized backlog with:
- Quick wins (high impact, low effort)
- Strategic fixes (high impact, high effort)
- Nice-to-haves (low impact)

Format as JIRA-ready tickets with acceptance criteria."
```

## Debt Remediation Strategies

### 1. Incremental Refactoring
```yaml
incremental_refactoring:
  approach: "Boy Scout Rule - leave code better than found"
  
  tactics:
    - extract_method:
        when: "Function >20 lines"
        how: "Extract logical chunks to named methods"
        
    - introduce_parameter_object:
        when: "Method has >3 parameters"
        how: "Group related parameters into objects"
        
    - replace_conditional_with_polymorphism:
        when: "Large if/else or switch statements"
        how: "Use strategy pattern or inheritance"
        
  tracking:
    - before_complexity: measure_cyclomatic_complexity()
    - after_complexity: measure_cyclomatic_complexity()
    - time_spent: track_in_jira()
```

### 2. Debt Sprints
```yaml
debt_sprint_planning:
  frequency: "1 sprint per quarter"
  allocation: "100% team capacity"
  
  selection_criteria:
    - high_roi_items: "Impact/Effort > 10"
    - blockers: "Preventing new feature development"
    - security_critical: "Active vulnerabilities"
    
  sprint_goals:
    - reduce_complexity_by_20_percent
    - increase_test_coverage_to_90_percent
    - eliminate_critical_vulnerabilities
    - improve_build_time_by_50_percent
```

### 3. Continuous Debt Prevention
```yaml
debt_prevention:
  code_review_checklist:
    - no_new_complexity_over_threshold
    - test_coverage_maintained
    - no_duplicated_code
    - documentation_updated
    
  automated_gates:
    - pre_commit_hooks:
        - complexity_check
        - test_coverage_check
        - security_scan
        
    - ci_pipeline:
        - quality_gate_pass_required
        - no_new_debt_policy
        - debt_trend_monitoring
        
  education:
    - weekly_code_quality_reviews
    - refactoring_workshops
    - clean_code_book_club
```

## Debt Forecasting

### Predictive Models
```python
# debt_forecasting.py
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import pandas as pd

def forecast_technical_debt(historical_data):
    """Predict future technical debt accumulation"""
    
    # Features: team size, velocity, code size, feature complexity
    features = historical_data[['team_size', 'velocity', 'loc', 'complexity']]
    debt_metrics = historical_data['debt_score']
    
    model = LinearRegression()
    model.fit(features, debt_metrics)
    
    # Forecast next 6 months
    future_predictions = []
    for month in range(1, 7):
        predicted_features = extrapolate_features(features, month)
        debt_prediction = model.predict(predicted_features)
        future_predictions.append({
            'month': month,
            'predicted_debt': debt_prediction,
            'debt_payment_needed': calculate_payment(debt_prediction)
        })
    
    return future_predictions
```

### AI Debt Analysis Queries
```bash
# Monthly debt report
ai "Generate technical debt report for the month:

1. New debt introduced:
   - By feature area
   - By team
   - Root causes

2. Debt paid down:
   - Refactoring completed
   - Tests added
   - Dependencies updated

3. Debt trending:
   - Overall debt score change
   - Velocity impact
   - Prediction for next month

4. Recommendations:
   - Top 5 items to address
   - Estimated ROI for each
   - Resource allocation suggestion

Format as executive dashboard with visualizations."

# Debt impact on features
ai "Analyze how technical debt affects feature delivery:

For each major feature in the last quarter:
- Time spent on debt-related issues
- Bugs caused by technical debt
- Additional testing required
- Refactoring needed

Calculate:
- Actual vs estimated delivery time
- Debt tax percentage
- Cost of delay

Recommend debt items to fix for faster feature delivery."
```

## Debt Metrics Dashboard

### Key Performance Indicators
```yaml
debt_kpis:
  debt_ratio:
    formula: "debt_time / total_development_time"
    target: "<20%"
    current: "{{current_ratio}}%"
    
  debt_velocity:
    formula: "new_debt - debt_paid"
    target: "negative (paying down)"
    current: "{{debt_velocity}}"
    
  code_quality_score:
    formula: "weighted_average(all_quality_metrics)"
    target: ">B rating"
    current: "{{quality_score}}"
    
  time_to_market_impact:
    formula: "feature_time_with_debt / feature_time_optimal"
    target: "<1.2x"
    current: "{{impact_ratio}}x"
```

### Automated Reporting
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# generate_debt_report.sh

# Collect metrics
echo "Collecting technical debt metrics..."
./scripts/run_all_analyzers.sh > metrics.json

# Generate visualizations
python visualize_debt.py metrics.json --output charts/

# AI-powered insights
ai "Analyze technical debt metrics in metrics.json:
- Identify concerning trends
- Compare against industry benchmarks
- Suggest immediate actions
- Predict 3-month outlook
- Generate executive summary

Output as HTML report with embedded charts."

# Send report
./scripts/send_report.sh --to tech-leadership@company.com
```

## Best Practices

1. **Make Debt Visible**: Dashboard prominently displayed
2. **Allocate Time**: 20% of capacity for debt reduction
3. **Prevent New Debt**: Strong quality gates
4. **Celebrate Paydown**: Recognize debt reduction work
5. **Learn from Debt**: Post-mortems on how debt accumulated

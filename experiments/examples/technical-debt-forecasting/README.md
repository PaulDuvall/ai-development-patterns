# Technical Debt Forecasting Implementation

This directory contains a complete implementation of the Technical Debt Forecasting pattern, proactively identifying and prioritizing technical debt using AI-powered code analysis.

## Overview

Technical Debt Forecasting enables teams to:
- Proactively identify technical debt before it becomes critical
- Prioritize debt remediation by business impact and maintenance cost
- Forecast future maintenance burden and resource requirements
- Track technical debt trends and improvement progress

## Files in this Implementation

- `debt_analysis.md` - Complete technical debt forecasting documentation
- `analyzers/` - Code quality and complexity analysis tools
- `forecasting_models/` - AI-powered debt growth prediction models
- `prioritization_engines/` - Business impact and cost analysis tools
- `tracking_dashboards/` - Technical debt monitoring and reporting

## Technical Debt Categories

### Code Complexity
- Cyclomatic complexity hotspots
- Method and class size violations
- Deep inheritance hierarchies
- Excessive parameter counts

### Architecture Debt
- Circular dependencies
- Tight coupling between modules
- Missing abstraction layers
- Architectural pattern violations

### Documentation Debt
- Missing or outdated documentation
- Code without comments
- API documentation gaps
- Architectural decision records missing

### Test Debt
- Low test coverage areas
- Flaky or brittle tests
- Missing integration tests
- Outdated test dependencies

## Quick Start

```bash
# Analyze current technical debt state
./analyze-technical-debt.sh --full-scan

# Generate debt forecast
ai "Analyze codebase for technical debt indicators and forecast maintenance burden:
1. Code complexity hotspots
2. Cyclomatic complexity trends  
3. Dependency staleness
4. Test coverage gaps
5. Documentation drift
Prioritize by maintenance cost and business impact."

# Create remediation roadmap
./create-roadmap.sh --prioritize-by impact --timeline quarters
```

# Architecture Patterns and Guidelines

## Approved Libraries and Frameworks

### Backend (Python)
- Web Framework: FastAPI (preferred) or Flask
- Database ORM: SQLAlchemy with Alembic migrations
- Authentication: PyJWT for token handling
- HTTP Client: httpx (async) or requests
- Testing: pytest with pytest-asyncio
- Validation: Pydantic for data models

### Frontend (JavaScript/TypeScript)
- Framework: React with TypeScript
- State Management: Zustand (preferred) or Redux Toolkit
- HTTP Client: axios
- UI Components: shadcn/ui or Material-UI
- Testing: Jest with React Testing Library
- Build Tool: Vite

### Database
- Primary: PostgreSQL for transactional data
- Cache: Redis for session storage and caching
- Search: Elasticsearch for full-text search
- Time Series: InfluxDB for metrics and monitoring

## Architecture Principles
- Use layered architecture (Controller → Service → Repository)
- Implement dependency injection for testability
- Separate business logic from infrastructure concerns
- Use event-driven architecture for loose coupling
- Implement circuit breakers for external service calls

## Design Patterns
- Repository pattern for data access
- Factory pattern for object creation
- Observer pattern for event handling
- Strategy pattern for algorithm selection
- Command pattern for request handling

## Security Architecture
- Zero-trust network model
- API Gateway for all external requests
- Service mesh for internal communication
- Secrets management via external vault
- Audit logging for all data access

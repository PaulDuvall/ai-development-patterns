# Refactoring Rules

## Long Method Smell
- Max lines: 20 (excluding docstrings)
- Max cyclomatic complexity: 10
- Detection: flake8 C901, pylint R0915

## Large Class Smell  
- Max class lines: 250
- Max methods: 20
- Max instance variables: 10
- Detection: pylint R0902, R0904

## Primitive Obsession Smell
- String validation patterns in multiple places
- Dictionaries as pseudo-objects
- Lists of primitives that always travel together

## Refactoring Strategies
- Extract Method for long methods
- Extract Class for large classes
- Replace Primitive with Object for primitive obsession

# Testing Requirements for AI Development

## Coverage Thresholds
- Minimum 80% code coverage for critical paths
- 90% coverage required for AI-generated code
- 100% coverage for security-related functions
- Branch coverage minimum 75%

## Test Types Required
- Unit tests for all new functions and methods
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end acceptance tests for user journeys
- Security vulnerability scans for all dependencies
- Performance benchmarks for critical operations

## Test Structure
- Use Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- One assertion per test case
- Descriptive test names that explain expected behavior
- Test data isolation - no shared state between tests
- Mock external dependencies in unit tests

## Quality Gates
- All tests must pass before merge
- No flaky tests allowed - fix or delete
- Test execution time <5 minutes for full suite
- Performance tests must not regress >10%
- Security scans must show no critical vulnerabilities

## AI-Generated Test Requirements
- Review all AI-generated tests for edge cases
- Verify test data covers boundary conditions
- Ensure negative test cases are included
- Validate that tests actually test the intended behavior

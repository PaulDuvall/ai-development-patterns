# CI/CD Pipeline Specification

This file defines the CI/CD pipeline requirements in plain English, which can be converted to specific pipeline configurations using AI assistance.

## Build Pipeline Specification

### Dependencies Installation
```
install dependencies -> pip install -r requirements.txt
verify installation -> pip check
cache dependencies -> use pip cache for faster builds
```

### Code Quality Checks
```
code formatting -> black --check src/ tests/
import sorting -> isort --check-only src/ tests/  
linting -> flake8 src/ tests/
type checking -> mypy src/
complexity check -> radon cc src/ --min C
security scan -> bandit -r src/
```

### Testing Pipeline
```
unit tests -> pytest tests/unit/ -v --cov=src --cov-report=xml
integration tests -> pytest tests/integration/ -v
acceptance tests -> pytest tests/acceptance/ -v
performance tests -> pytest tests/performance/ --benchmark-json=benchmark.json
```

### Security Validation
```
dependency check -> safety check --json
secrets detection -> trufflehog filesystem src/ --json
license compliance -> pip-licenses --format=json
container scan -> trivy image myapp:latest
```

### Build Artifacts
```
build application -> docker build -t myapp:${BUILD_NUMBER} .
tag latest -> docker tag myapp:${BUILD_NUMBER} myapp:latest
run health check -> docker run --rm myapp:latest /health-check.sh
```

### Deployment Pipeline
```
push to registry -> docker push myapp:${BUILD_NUMBER}
deploy to staging -> kubectl apply -f k8s/staging/
run smoke tests -> pytest tests/smoke/ --env=staging
promote to production -> kubectl apply -f k8s/production/
verify deployment -> kubectl rollout status deployment/myapp
```

## Environment-Specific Configuration

### Development Environment
```
triggers -> on every push to feature branches
quality gates -> 80% test coverage, no critical security issues
notifications -> slack #dev-team on failure
parallelization -> run tests in parallel
caching -> cache dependencies and docker layers
```

### Staging Environment  
```
triggers -> on merge to main branch
quality gates -> 90% test coverage, full security scan
deployment -> automatic after all checks pass
testing -> full integration and acceptance test suite
rollback -> automatic on health check failure
notifications -> slack #devops and email to stakeholders
```

### Production Environment
```
triggers -> manual approval after staging validation
quality gates -> all tests pass, security review complete
deployment strategy -> blue-green deployment
monitoring -> enhanced monitoring during deployment
rollback -> immediate rollback on any issue
notifications -> slack #alerts, email to on-call, PagerDuty integration
```

## Pipeline Performance Requirements

### Build Time Targets
```
unit tests -> complete within 5 minutes
integration tests -> complete within 10 minutes
full pipeline -> complete within 20 minutes
docker build -> complete within 8 minutes
deployment -> complete within 15 minutes
```

### Resource Utilization
```
concurrent builds -> maximum 3 parallel builds
cpu usage -> limit to 2 cores per build
memory usage -> limit to 4GB per build
disk space -> cleanup after each build
```

## Quality Gates

### Code Quality Thresholds
```
test coverage -> minimum 90% for production deployment
cyclomatic complexity -> maximum 10 per function
code duplication -> maximum 5% duplication
maintainability index -> minimum B rating
security vulnerabilities -> zero critical, zero high
```

### Performance Thresholds
```
api response time -> p95 < 500ms
database query time -> max 100ms per query
memory usage -> < 512MB for application
startup time -> < 30 seconds
```

## Failure Handling

### Retry Strategy
```
flaky tests -> retry up to 3 times
network timeouts -> retry with exponential backoff
dependency downloads -> retry with mirror fallback
deployment failures -> automatic rollback
```

### Notification Rules
```
build failure -> immediate slack notification
security issue -> immediate email to security team
production deployment -> notify all stakeholders
performance regression -> alert performance team
```

## Monitoring and Observability

### Build Metrics
```
build success rate -> track over time
build duration -> alert if exceeds thresholds  
test execution time -> identify slow tests
failure patterns -> analyze common failure causes
```

### Deployment Metrics
```
deployment frequency -> track releases per week
lead time -> measure commit to production time
mean time to recovery -> track incident response
change failure rate -> monitor rollback frequency
```

## Integration Points

### Version Control Integration
```
github webhooks -> trigger builds on push
pull request checks -> require all checks to pass
branch protection -> prevent direct pushes to main
commit status -> update PR with build results
```

### External Service Integration
```
slack notifications -> build and deployment status
email alerts -> critical failures and security issues
jira integration -> link deployments to tickets
monitoring -> send metrics to datadog/prometheus
```

## Compliance and Audit

### Audit Trail
```
build logs -> retain for 90 days
deployment history -> track all changes
approval workflow -> require approval for production
change documentation -> auto-generate release notes
```

### Compliance Checks
```
license scanning -> ensure approved licenses only
vulnerability database -> check against known CVEs
configuration validation -> verify security settings
data classification -> ensure proper data handling
```

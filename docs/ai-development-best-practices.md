# AI Development Best Practices

A canonical, enumerated list of best practices derived from comprehensive analysis of AI-assisted development patterns and real-world implementations. Each practice is actionable and stated in 1-2 crisp sentences.

## Foundation & Team Readiness

1. **Assess Before Implementing**: Systematically evaluate team and codebase readiness using structured assessment frameworks before introducing AI development patterns.

2. **Establish Rules as Code**: Store AI coding standards, prompts, and preferences in versioned `.ai/` configuration directories rather than relying on ad-hoc prompting.

3. **Security by Design**: Run AI tools in isolated environments with no network access, no system privileges, and read-only source code access to prevent credential leaks.

4. **Start Small, Scale Systematically**: Begin with simple AI-assisted tasks and progressively enhance complexity rather than attempting comprehensive solutions immediately.

## Workflow & Development Process

5. **Specification-Driven Development**: Write machine-readable specifications with clear authority levels before using AI for implementation to ensure consistent, testable outcomes.

6. **Test-First AI Development**: Create specifications and tests before implementation, then use AI to generate code that satisfies behavioral requirements.

7. **Progressive Enhancement Over Big-Bang**: Build features through small, deployable iterations with daily feedback cycles rather than large-scale AI generation attempts.

8. **Structured Development Lifecycle**: Follow a systematic 9-stage process from problem definition through deployment and monitoring for consistent AI-assisted development.

9. **Size Tasks Appropriately**: Use 4-8 hour work items for standard development and 1-2 hour atomic tasks for parallel AI agent execution.

10. **Generate Structured Work Items**: Break down features into specific, testable tasks with clear acceptance criteria using AI to ensure continuous development flow.

## Quality & Testing

11. **Comprehensive AI Testing Strategy**: Generate complete test suites (unit, integration, performance, security) automatically from specifications using AI assistance.

12. **Maintain Test-to-Specification Traceability**: Link every specification requirement to automated tests with anchored references and coverage tracking.

13. **Observable Development**: Design systems with comprehensive logging that includes operation context, correlation IDs, and specific error details for AI analysis.

14. **Avoid Black Box Implementations**: Ensure every operation provides sufficient context for AI diagnosis and improvement rather than generic error messages.

15. **Validate AI Output**: Always verify AI-generated code through automated testing and human review, especially for security and deployment configurations.

## Parallel & Multi-Agent Development

16. **Safe Agent Parallelization**: Use container isolation or Git worktrees to prevent AI agents from interfering with concurrent work on shared codebases.

17. **Implement Resource Locking**: Use file-based locking and atomic operations when multiple AI agents need to access shared resources or directories.

18. **Atomic Task Decomposition**: Break complex features into independently implementable tasks that can be completed in isolation without cross-dependencies.

19. **Shared Memory for Coordination**: Enable AI agents to share discoveries and coordinate work while maintaining strict isolation boundaries for safety.

20. **Conflict Detection and Resolution**: Implement automated systems to detect and resolve integration conflicts between parallel AI agent outputs.

## Knowledge & Context Management

21. **Capture Persistent Knowledge**: Document successful patterns (>80% success rate) and failure modes (>30 minutes wasted) in structured, searchable formats.

22. **Focus on High-Impact Knowledge**: Avoid knowledge hoarding by capturing only patterns that significantly accelerate development or prevent common failures.

23. **Context Window Optimization**: Match AI tool selection to task complexity - simple models for quick queries, complex models for architecture decisions.

24. **Visual Context Scaffolding**: Use diagrams, mockups, and flows as primary specifications rather than describing complex requirements entirely in text.

25. **Version Knowledge Assets**: Treat AI development knowledge as code with proper versioning, review processes, and continuous improvement cycles.

## Tool Design & Integration

26. **Smart Defaults with Extensibility**: Design AI development tools that work perfectly with no configuration while supporting advanced customization options.

27. **Self-Documenting Commands**: Include comprehensive built-in help with usage patterns, examples, and parameter explanations in every AI development tool.

28. **Hooks-Based Governance**: Implement flexible hook systems for automated monitoring, logging, and policy enforcement at critical development workflow points.

29. **Modular Command Architecture**: Organize AI tools into clear categories with well-defined scopes (project-specific vs. machine-wide) for flexible workflows.

30. **Use Specialized Subagents**: Use [subagents](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents) to offload specialized tasks to isolated AI assistants with custom prompts, tools, and context for consistent, focused execution.

31. **Experimental Design Frameworks**: Treat experimental AI development features as sophisticated specifications that map future advanced workflows.

## Operations & Automation

32. **Policy as Code Generation**: Transform compliance requirements into executable Cedar/OPA policy files using AI assistance for consistency and automation.

33. **Intelligent Security Orchestration**: Aggregate multiple security tools and use AI to summarize findings, reducing alert fatigue while maintaining rigor.

34. **AI-Powered Performance Baselines**: Use AI to analyze historical data and establish intelligent monitoring thresholds that minimize false positives.

35. **Automated Incident Response**: Generate actionable playbooks from historical incident data and continuously improve operational procedures.

36. **Infrastructure as Specifications**: Generate deployment configurations and infrastructure code from plain-English requirements using AI assistance.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

37. **No Assessment Rush**: Don't implement AI development patterns without first evaluating team readiness and codebase architecture quality.

38. **Avoid Ad-Hoc Development**: Don't jump directly to AI coding without structured lifecycle processes, proper planning, or testing strategy.

39. **No Implementation-First Development**: Don't generate code first then retrofit tests - always establish specifications and tests before implementation.

40. **Prevent Uncoordinated Parallelization**: Don't run multiple AI agents without proper isolation, conflict detection, or resolution mechanisms.

41. **No Black Box Systems**: Don't build systems with minimal observability that prevent AI from understanding behavior and diagnosing issues.

42. **Avoid One-Size-Fits-All Tools**: Don't use the most powerful (expensive) AI models for simple tasks that could be handled by lighter alternatives.

43. **No Manual Policy Translation**: Don't manually translate compliance requirements when AI can generate consistent, testable policy code.

44. **Prevent Manual Evidence Collection**: Don't manually gather compliance evidence when AI can continuously collect and organize audit trails automatically.

# AI Development Best Practices

A canonical, enumerated list of best practices derived from comprehensive analysis of AI-assisted development patterns and real-world implementations. Each practice is actionable and stated in 1-2 crisp sentences.

## Foundation & Team Readiness

1. **Assess Before Implementing**: Systematically evaluate team and codebase readiness using structured assessment frameworks before introducing AI development patterns.

2. **Establish Rules as Code**: Store AI coding standards, prompts, and preferences in versioned `.ai/` configuration directories rather than relying on ad-hoc prompting.

3. **Security by Design**: Run AI tools in isolated environments with no network access, no system privileges, and read-only source code access to prevent credential leaks.

4. **Start Small, Scale Systematically**: Begin with simple AI-assisted tasks and progressively enhance complexity rather than attempting comprehensive solutions immediately.

## Workflow & Development Process

5. **Specification-Driven Development**: Write machine-readable specifications with explicit authority levels (system/platform/feature) and unique identifiers before AI implementation to ensure consistent, testable outcomes.

6. **Test-First AI Development**: Create automated tests from specifications before AI code generation, ensuring every specification has corresponding test coverage with measurable success criteria.

7. **Progressive Enhancement Over Big-Bang**: Apply Lean and Kanban principles by building features through small, deployable iterations with daily feedback cycles rather than large-scale AI generation attempts.

8. **Structured Development Lifecycle**: Follow a systematic 9-stage process from problem definition through deployment and monitoring for consistent AI-assisted development.

9. **Size Tasks Appropriately**: Use 4-8 hour work items for standard development and 1-2 hour atomic tasks for parallel AI agent execution.

10. **Generate Structured Work Items**: Break down features into specific, testable tasks with clear acceptance criteria using AI to ensure continuous development flow.

## Quality & Testing

11. **Comprehensive AI Testing Strategy**: Generate complete test suites (unit, integration, performance, security) automatically from specifications using AI assistance.

12. **Maintain Test-to-Specification Traceability**: Link every specification element to automated tests with anchored references and coverage tracking.

13. **Structured Observability**: Implement comprehensive logging with operation context, correlation IDs, and specific error details in standardized formats (JSON/structured) for AI analysis and debugging.

14. **Transparent Error Handling**: Design error messages and system responses with sufficient context for AI diagnosis, including error codes, affected components, and suggested remediation steps.

15. **Validate AI Output**: Always verify AI-generated code through automated testing and human review, especially for security and deployment configurations.

## Parallel & Multi-Agent Development

16. **Safe Agent Parallelization**: Use container isolation or Git worktrees to prevent AI agents from interfering with concurrent work on shared codebases.

17. **Implement Resource Locking**: Use file-based locking and atomic operations when multiple AI agents need to access shared resources or directories.

18. **Atomic Task Decomposition**: Break complex features into independently implementable tasks that can be completed in isolation without cross-dependencies.

19. **Shared Memory for Coordination**: Enable AI agents to share discoveries and coordinate work while maintaining strict isolation boundaries for safety.

20. **Conflict Detection and Resolution**: Implement automated systems to detect and resolve integration conflicts between parallel AI agent outputs.

## Knowledge & Context Management

21. **Capture High-Impact Knowledge**: Document successful patterns (>80% success rate) and failure modes (>30 minutes wasted) in structured, searchable formats with specific success metrics and context.

22. **Context Window Optimization**: Match AI tool selection to task complexity using defined criteria: simple models for queries <500 tokens, complex models for architecture decisions >2000 tokens.

23. **Visual Context Scaffolding**: Use diagrams, mockups, and flows as primary specifications for complex needs, supplemented with structured text for precise details.

24. **Version Knowledge Assets**: Treat AI development knowledge as code with semantic versioning, peer review processes, and automated quality checks.

25. **AI Model Lifecycle Management**: Establish systematic processes for AI model versioning, performance monitoring, drift detection, and automated retraining triggers.

## Tool Design & Integration

26. **Smart Defaults with Extensibility**: Design AI development tools that work perfectly with no configuration while supporting advanced customization options.

27. **Self-Documenting Commands**: Include comprehensive built-in help with usage patterns, examples, and parameter explanations in every AI development tool.

28. **Hooks-Based Governance**: Implement flexible hook systems for automated monitoring, logging, and policy enforcement at critical development workflow points.

29. **Modular Command Architecture**: Organize AI tools into clear categories with well-defined scopes (project-specific vs. machine-wide) for flexible workflows.

30. **Use Specialized Subagents**: Use [subagents](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents) to offload specialized tasks to isolated AI assistants with custom prompts, tools, and context for consistent, focused execution.

31. **Experimental Design Frameworks**: Treat experimental AI development features as sophisticated specifications that map future advanced workflows.

## Operations & Automation

32. **Policy as Code Generation**: Transform compliance specifications into executable Cedar/OPA policy files using AI assistance for consistency and automation.

33. **Intelligent Security Orchestration**: Aggregate multiple security tools and use AI to summarize findings, reducing alert fatigue while maintaining rigor.

34. **AI-Powered Performance Baselines**: Use AI to analyze historical data and establish intelligent monitoring thresholds that minimize false positives.

35. **Automated Incident Response**: Generate actionable playbooks from historical incident data and continuously improve operational procedures.

36. **Infrastructure as Specifications**: Generate deployment configurations and infrastructure code from plain-English specifications using AI assistance.

37. **Operational Readiness Reviews (ORRs)**: Conduct systematic pre-deployment reviews using data-driven checklists derived from past incidents to prevent known operational risks across workloads.

## AI Ethics & Model Governance

38. **Bias Detection and Mitigation**: Implement automated bias testing in AI model outputs using diverse test datasets and continuous monitoring for fairness across demographic groups.

39. **AI Decision Transparency**: Ensure AI-generated decisions include explainable reasoning, confidence scores, and alternative options when impacting user experience or business logic.

40. **Model Performance Monitoring**: Establish automated monitoring for AI model accuracy, latency, and drift with defined thresholds for performance degradation alerts.

41. **Ethical AI Boundaries**: Define explicit constraints for AI tool usage including prohibited use cases, data privacy specifications, and human oversight specifications for critical decisions.

42. **AI Output Validation**: Implement multi-layered validation including automated testing, peer review, and domain expert verification for AI-generated code and configurations.

## AI-Enhanced Traditional Practices

43. **SOLID Principles for AI Code**: Apply Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion specifically to AI-generated code to ensure maintainable, extensible systems.

44. **Clean Architecture with AI Layers**: Structure AI applications using Clean Architecture principles with dedicated layers for AI model interfaces, business rules, and external AI service dependencies.

45. **Domain-Driven Design for AI Systems**: Use DDD bounded contexts to separate AI model domains, ensuring clear boundaries between different AI capabilities and business contexts.

46. **Well-Architected AI Systems**: Apply AWS Well-Architected Framework pillars (Operational Excellence, Security, Reliability, Performance, Cost Optimization, Sustainability) specifically to AI workloads and model deployments.

47. **Contract-First AI Integration**: Define clear contracts and interfaces for AI components using Design by Contract principles, ensuring predictable behavior and error handling.

48. **Lean AI Development**: Apply Lean principles to eliminate waste in AI model training, reduce unnecessary experimentation, and focus on value-delivering AI features.

49. **Continuous Integration for AI**: Implement CI pipelines that include AI model validation, performance regression testing, and automated deployment of AI components alongside traditional code.

50. **Chaos Engineering for AI Systems**: Apply chaos engineering principles to AI systems by introducing controlled failures in AI model responses, degraded model performance, and service dependencies.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

51. **No Assessment Rush**: Don't implement AI development patterns without first evaluating team readiness and codebase architecture quality.

52. **Avoid Ad-Hoc Development**: Don't jump directly to AI coding without structured lifecycle processes, proper planning, or testing strategy.

53. **No Implementation-First Development**: Don't generate code first then retrofit tests - always establish specifications and tests before implementation.

54. **Prevent Uncoordinated Parallelization**: Don't run multiple AI agents without proper isolation, conflict detection, or resolution mechanisms.

55. **No Black Box Systems**: Don't build systems with minimal observability that prevent AI from understanding behavior and diagnosing issues.

56. **Avoid One-Size-Fits-All Tools**: Don't use the most powerful (expensive) AI models for simple tasks that could be handled by lighter alternatives.

57. **No Manual Policy Translation**: Don't manually translate compliance specifications when AI can generate consistent, testable policy code.

58. **Prevent Manual Evidence Collection**: Don't manually gather compliance evidence when AI can continuously collect and organize audit trails automatically.

59. **Avoid Monolithic AI Architecture**: Don't build large, coupled AI systems that violate Single Responsibility Principle and are difficult to test and maintain.

60. **No AI Without Contracts**: Don't integrate AI components without clear interface contracts, error handling specifications, and fallback mechanisms.

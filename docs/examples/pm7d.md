# Payment Audit Trail Specification {#pm7d}

## Overview {#overview}
This specification defines comprehensive audit trail requirements for payment processing systems, ensuring compliance with financial regulations and enabling forensic analysis of payment activities.

## Audit Logging Requirements {#audit_logging authority=platform}

### Transaction Logging {#transaction_logging authority=platform}
The system MUST:
- Log every payment transaction with complete audit details [^pm7d1]
- Record transaction timestamps with millisecond precision [^pm7d2]
- Include user identification, amount, and merchant information [^pm7d3]
- Capture payment method details without exposing sensitive data [^pm7d4]

### System Activity Logging {#system_activity authority=platform}
The system MUST:
- Log all administrative actions affecting payment processing [^pm7d5]
- Record configuration changes with before/after values [^pm7d6]
- Track user authentication and authorization events [^pm7d7]
- Monitor payment system component health and status changes [^pm7d8]

### Security Event Logging {#security_logging authority=platform}
The system MUST:
- Log all security-related events including failed authentication [^pm7d9]
- Record fraud detection alerts and response actions [^pm7d10]
- Track access to sensitive payment data and configurations [^pm7d11]
- Monitor for unusual patterns indicating potential security incidents [^pm7d12]

## Log Management {#log_management authority=platform}

### Log Storage {#log_storage authority=platform}
The system MUST:
- Store audit logs in tamper-evident, immutable storage [^pm7d13]
- Implement log encryption both in transit and at rest [^pm7d14]
- Maintain log retention for minimum regulatory compliance periods [^pm7d15]
- Provide secure backup and disaster recovery for audit data [^pm7d16]

### Log Access Control {#log_access authority=platform}
The system MUST:
- Restrict audit log access to authorized personnel only [^pm7d17]
- Implement role-based permissions for different audit functions [^pm7d18]
- Log all access to audit logs with user attribution [^pm7d19]
- Prevent modification or deletion of historical audit records [^pm7d20]

## Compliance Reporting {#compliance_reporting authority=platform}

### Automated Reports {#automated_reports authority=system}
The system MUST:
- Generate compliance reports automatically on defined schedules [^pm7d21]
- Include transaction volume, value, and error rate statistics [^pm7d22]
- Provide exception reports for unusual or suspicious activities [^pm7d23]
- Format reports according to regulatory requirements [^pm7d24]

# Payment Card Data Security Specification {#pm7b}

## Overview {#overview}
This specification defines PCI DSS compliance requirements for payment card data handling, focusing on data protection, encryption, and secure processing workflows.

## Card Data Protection {#card_data_protection authority=platform}

### Data Encryption {#data_encryption authority=platform}
The system MUST:
- Encrypt all card data using AES-256 encryption in transit and at rest [^pm7b1]
- Use strong cryptographic keys with minimum 256-bit length [^pm7b2]
- Implement proper key management with regular rotation schedules [^pm7b3]
- Never store sensitive authentication data (CVV, PIN) after transaction [^pm7b4]

### Data Transmission {#data_transmission authority=platform}
The system MUST:
- Use TLS 1.3 or higher for all payment data transmission [^pm7b5]
- Validate SSL/TLS certificates and reject invalid connections [^pm7b6]
- Implement certificate pinning for payment gateway connections [^pm7b7]
- Log all payment data transmission events for audit compliance [^pm7b8]

### Data Storage {#data_storage authority=platform}
The system MUST:
- Minimize payment data storage to business-necessary elements only [^pm7b9]
- Implement data retention policies with automatic deletion [^pm7b10]
- Use tokenization for stored payment methods when possible [^pm7b11]
- Maintain secure key storage separate from encrypted data [^pm7b12]

## Access Controls {#access_controls authority=platform}

### Data Access {#data_access authority=platform}
The system MUST:
- Implement role-based access control for payment data [^pm7b13]
- Require multi-factor authentication for administrative access [^pm7b14]
- Log all access attempts to payment data with user attribution [^pm7b15]
- Implement need-to-know principle for data access [^pm7b16]

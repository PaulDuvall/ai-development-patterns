# Payment Method Fallback Specification {#pm9b}

## Overview {#overview}
This specification defines requirements for providing alternative payment methods when primary payment processing fails, ensuring customer transaction completion and business continuity.

## Alternative Payment Methods {#alternative_methods authority=system}

### Method Prioritization {#method_prioritization authority=system}
The system MUST:
- Maintain prioritized list of alternative payment methods per user [^pm9b1]
- Consider payment method success rates and processing costs [^pm9b2]
- Implement geographic and regulatory constraints for method selection [^pm9b3]
- Update priorities based on real-time payment method availability [^pm9b4]

### Automatic Method Selection {#automatic_selection authority=system}
The system MUST:
- Automatically present alternative methods when primary fails [^pm9b5]
- Pre-populate user payment preferences from stored profiles [^pm9b6]
- Validate alternative method compatibility with transaction requirements [^pm9b7]
- Provide clear explanation of why primary method was unavailable [^pm9b8]

### Payment Method Integration {#method_integration authority=system}
The system MUST:
- Support multiple payment processors for redundancy [^pm9b9]
- Implement unified payment interface across all methods [^pm9b10]
- Maintain consistent security standards across payment types [^pm9b11]
- Handle payment method-specific requirements and limitations [^pm9b12]

## User Experience {#user_experience authority=system}

### Seamless Transition {#seamless_transition authority=system}
The system MUST:
- Present alternative methods without requiring page refresh [^pm9b13]
- Maintain shopping cart and transaction context during method switch [^pm9b14]
- Preserve user input data when switching payment methods [^pm9b15]
- Provide one-click selection for previously used methods [^pm9b16]

### Method Recommendation {#method_recommendation authority=system}
The system MUST:
- Recommend optimal payment methods based on transaction context [^pm9b17]
- Consider factors like amount, merchant, and user location [^pm9b18]
- Display estimated processing times for different methods [^pm9b19]
- Show any fees or benefits associated with alternative methods [^pm9b20]

## Failure Recovery {#failure_recovery authority=system}

### Retry Logic {#retry_logic authority=system}
The system MUST:
- Implement intelligent retry strategies for different failure types [^pm9b21]
- Avoid repeated attempts that may cause permanent blocks [^pm9b22]
- Track failure patterns to improve method selection algorithms [^pm9b23]
- Provide manual retry options with user confirmation [^pm9b24]

### Escalation Procedures {#escalation authority=system}
The system MUST:
- Escalate to human support when all automated methods fail [^pm9b25]
- Provide detailed failure information for support team analysis [^pm9b26]
- Offer alternative transaction completion methods (email, phone) [^pm9b27]
- Maintain transaction context for later completion attempts [^pm9b28]

## Business Continuity {#business_continuity authority=platform}

### Revenue Protection {#revenue_protection authority=system}
The system MUST:
- Maximize transaction completion rates through method diversity [^pm9b29]
- Track conversion rates for each alternative payment method [^pm9b30]
- Optimize method presentation based on success analytics [^pm9b31]
- Minimize customer abandonment due to payment failures [^pm9b32]

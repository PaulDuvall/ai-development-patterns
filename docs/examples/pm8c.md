# Payment Data Protection Compliance Specification {#pm8c}

## Overview {#overview}
This specification defines strict data protection requirements for payment systems, ensuring compliance with PCI DSS standards and preventing unauthorized access to sensitive payment information.

## Data Protection Requirements {#data_protection authority=platform}

### Prohibited Data Storage {#prohibited_storage authority=platform}
The system MUST:
- Never store full magnetic stripe data after transaction authorization [^pm8c1]
- Prohibit storage of card verification codes (CVV/CVC) permanently [^pm8c2]
- Never retain PIN data in any form after verification [^pm8c3]
- Prevent storage of track data beyond immediate processing needs [^pm8c4]

### Secure Data Handling {#secure_handling authority=platform}
The system MUST:
- Mask or truncate card numbers in all displays and logs [^pm8c5]
- Implement secure memory allocation for temporary sensitive data [^pm8c6]
- Clear sensitive data from memory immediately after use [^pm8c7]
- Use secure channels for all sensitive data transmission [^pm8c8]

### Access Control {#access_control authority=platform}
The system MUST:
- Implement principle of least privilege for payment data access [^pm8c9]
- Require dual authorization for sensitive payment system changes [^pm8c10]
- Log all access attempts to payment data with full audit trail [^pm8c11]
- Enforce time-based access controls with automatic session expiration [^pm8c12]

## Data Encryption Standards {#encryption_standards authority=platform}

### Encryption in Transit {#encryption_transit authority=platform}
The system MUST:
- Use TLS 1.3 or higher for all payment data communication [^pm8c13]
- Implement perfect forward secrecy for key exchange [^pm8c14]
- Validate all SSL/TLS certificates and reject invalid connections [^pm8c15]
- Use secure cryptographic protocols only (no deprecated ciphers) [^pm8c16]

### Encryption at Rest {#encryption_rest authority=platform}
The system MUST:
- Encrypt all stored payment data using AES-256 or equivalent [^pm8c17]
- Implement proper key management with hardware security modules [^pm8c18]
- Separate encryption keys from encrypted data storage [^pm8c19]
- Rotate encryption keys according to industry best practices [^pm8c20]

## Vulnerability Management {#vulnerability_management authority=platform}

### Security Testing {#security_testing authority=platform}
The system MUST:
- Conduct regular penetration testing of payment components [^pm8c21]
- Perform automated vulnerability scans on payment infrastructure [^pm8c22]
- Implement secure code review processes for payment modules [^pm8c23]
- Maintain current security patches for all payment system components [^pm8c24]

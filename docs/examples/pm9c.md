# Payment Transaction Integrity Specification {#pm9c}

## Overview {#overview}
This specification defines transaction integrity requirements for payment systems under failure conditions, ensuring data consistency, preventing financial discrepancies, and maintaining audit compliance.

## Transaction Integrity Requirements {#transaction_integrity authority=platform}

### Atomic Operations {#atomic_operations authority=platform}
The system MUST:
- Ensure all transaction operations complete fully or not at all [^pm9c1]
- Implement distributed transaction coordination across services [^pm9c2]
- Prevent partial transaction states that could cause data inconsistency [^pm9c3]
- Provide rollback mechanisms for failed transaction components [^pm9c4]

### State Consistency {#state_consistency authority=platform}
The system MUST:
- Maintain consistent account balances across all system failures [^pm9c5]
- Synchronize transaction states between payment and business systems [^pm9c6]
- Prevent double-charging or duplicate transaction processing [^pm9c7]
- Ensure inventory and payment state alignment for e-commerce transactions [^pm9c8]

### Data Durability {#data_durability authority=platform}
The system MUST:
- Persist transaction data before acknowledging success to users [^pm9c9]
- Implement transaction log replication across multiple data centers [^pm9c10]
- Provide transaction recovery capabilities after system crashes [^pm9c11]
- Maintain transaction immutability once committed [^pm9c12]

## Failure Scenario Handling {#failure_handling authority=platform}

### Network Partition Tolerance {#network_partition authority=platform}
The system MUST:
- Continue processing transactions during network partitions [^pm9c13]
- Implement eventual consistency for distributed transaction components [^pm9c14]
- Detect and resolve conflicts when partition is healed [^pm9c15]
- Prioritize transaction safety over availability during partitions [^pm9c16]

### Database Failure Recovery {#database_failure authority=platform}
The system MUST:
- Implement automatic database failover with transaction consistency [^pm9c17]
- Provide point-in-time recovery for transaction databases [^pm9c18]
- Validate data integrity after database recovery procedures [^pm9c19]
- Maintain transaction ordering during database failover events [^pm9c20]

### Service Failure Isolation {#service_failure authority=system}
The system MUST:
- Isolate payment service failures from other system components [^pm9c21]
- Implement circuit breakers to prevent cascade failures [^pm9c22]
- Provide graceful degradation when dependent services fail [^pm9c23]
- Maintain partial functionality during service outages [^pm9c24]

## Reconciliation and Audit {#reconciliation authority=platform}

### Automated Reconciliation {#automated_reconciliation authority=platform}
The system MUST:
- Perform real-time transaction reconciliation across systems [^pm9c25]
- Detect and flag discrepancies automatically [^pm9c26]
- Generate reconciliation reports for financial audit requirements [^pm9c27]
- Implement automated correction for known discrepancy patterns [^pm9c28]

### Audit Trail Integrity {#audit_integrity authority=platform}
The system MUST:
- Maintain immutable audit logs for all transaction activities [^pm9c29]
- Implement cryptographic signatures for audit log integrity [^pm9c30]
- Provide complete transaction lineage from initiation to completion [^pm9c31]
- Support forensic analysis of transaction integrity violations [^pm9c32]

## Compliance and Reporting {#compliance authority=platform}

### Regulatory Compliance {#regulatory_compliance authority=platform}
The system MUST:
- Ensure transaction integrity meets financial regulatory requirements [^pm9c33]
- Provide compliance reports demonstrating transaction integrity [^pm9c34]
- Support regulatory audits with complete transaction documentation [^pm9c35]
- Implement controls required by financial services regulations [^pm9c36]

# Payment System Failover Specification {#pm9a}

## Overview {#overview}
This specification defines graceful degradation requirements for payment systems during outages, ensuring transaction integrity and user experience are maintained even under failure conditions.

## Failover Requirements {#failover_requirements authority=platform}

### Gateway Redundancy {#gateway_redundancy authority=system}
The system MUST:
- Maintain multiple payment gateway connections for redundancy [^pm9a1]
- Implement automatic failover to backup gateways within 30 seconds [^pm9a2]
- Route transactions based on gateway availability and performance [^pm9a3]
- Monitor gateway health continuously with circuit breaker patterns [^pm9a4]

### Transaction Queuing {#transaction_queuing authority=system}
The system MUST:
- Queue transactions safely during temporary gateway outages [^pm9a5]
- Implement persistent storage for queued transaction data [^pm9a6]
- Process queued transactions in order once connectivity is restored [^pm9a7]
- Provide transaction status updates to users during queuing [^pm9a8]

### Data Integrity {#data_integrity authority=platform}
The system MUST:
- Ensure transaction atomicity across all failure scenarios [^pm9a9]
- Implement idempotency keys to prevent duplicate charges [^pm9a10]
- Maintain transaction state consistency during failover events [^pm9a11]
- Provide transaction reconciliation after outage recovery [^pm9a12]

## Graceful Degradation {#graceful_degradation authority=system}

### Service Level Prioritization {#service_prioritization authority=system}
The system MUST:
- Prioritize critical payment functions during resource constraints [^pm9a13]
- Disable non-essential features to maintain core payment processing [^pm9a14]
- Implement rate limiting to preserve system stability [^pm9a15]
- Provide clear service status communication to users [^pm9a16]

### Alternative Processing {#alternative_processing authority=system}
The system MUST:
- Support alternative payment methods during primary gateway outages [^pm9a17]
- Implement offline payment approval for known customers [^pm9a18]
- Provide manual payment processing capabilities for critical transactions [^pm9a19]
- Maintain audit trail for all alternative processing methods [^pm9a20]

## Recovery Procedures {#recovery_procedures authority=system}

### Automated Recovery {#automated_recovery authority=system}
The system MUST:
- Detect service restoration automatically through health checks [^pm9a21]
- Resume normal operation without manual intervention [^pm9a22]
- Process queued transactions with appropriate retry logic [^pm9a23]
- Validate system state integrity after recovery [^pm9a24]

### Manual Intervention {#manual_intervention authority=system}
The system MUST:
- Provide administrative tools for manual failover control [^pm9a25]
- Support forced transaction processing during emergencies [^pm9a26]
- Enable system state validation and correction procedures [^pm9a27]
- Maintain detailed logs of all manual interventions [^pm9a28]

# Payment Fraud Detection Specification {#pm7c}

## Overview {#overview}
This specification defines fraud detection and prevention requirements for payment processing systems, focusing on real-time monitoring, risk assessment, and automated response mechanisms.

## Fraud Detection Requirements {#fraud_detection authority=platform}

### Real-time Monitoring {#realtime_monitoring authority=system}
The system MUST:
- Analyze transaction patterns in real-time for anomaly detection [^pm7c1]
- Compare current transactions against user historical behavior [^pm7c2]
- Implement velocity checks for transaction frequency and amounts [^pm7c3]
- Monitor for suspicious geographic location changes [^pm7c4]

### Risk Scoring {#risk_scoring authority=system}
The system MUST:
- Calculate risk scores for all transactions using multiple factors [^pm7c5]
- Consider transaction amount, merchant category, and timing patterns [^pm7c6]
- Incorporate device fingerprinting and behavioral analytics [^pm7c7]
- Update risk models based on confirmed fraud patterns [^pm7c8]

### Automated Response {#automated_response authority=system}
The system MUST:
- Block transactions exceeding high-risk thresholds automatically [^pm7c9]
- Require additional verification for medium-risk transactions [^pm7c10]
- Generate fraud alerts for human review within defined timeframes [^pm7c11]
- Maintain audit trail of all fraud detection decisions [^pm7c12]

## Machine Learning Integration {#ml_integration authority=system}

### Model Training {#model_training authority=system}
The system MUST:
- Train fraud detection models on representative transaction data [^pm7c13]
- Implement continuous learning from fraud confirmation feedback [^pm7c14]
- Validate model performance against holdout test datasets [^pm7c15]
- Monitor for model drift and performance degradation [^pm7c16]

### Feature Engineering {#feature_engineering authority=system}
The system MUST:
- Extract relevant features from transaction and user data [^pm7c17]
- Implement privacy-preserving feature extraction methods [^pm7c18]
- Validate feature importance and correlation analysis [^pm7c19]
- Update feature sets based on emerging fraud patterns [^pm7c20]

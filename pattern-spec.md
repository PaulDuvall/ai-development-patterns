# AI Development Patterns Specification

This document defines the standard structure, content requirements, and formatting guidelines for AI development patterns in this collection.

## Document Structure Requirements

### Complete Pattern Reference Table
The main documentation MUST include a comprehensive reference table at the beginning that:
- Lists ALL patterns in the collection
- Includes maturity level, category, description, and dependencies for each pattern
- Provides internal reference links to each pattern using format: `[Pattern Name](#pattern-name-anchor)`
- Organizes patterns by category (Foundation → Development → Operations)
- Uses sub-category headers for Operations patterns (Security & Compliance, Deployment Automation, Monitoring & Maintenance)

### Internal Reference Links
- EVERY pattern mentioned anywhere in the document MUST be hyperlinked to its section
- Use consistent anchor format: `#pattern-name-in-lowercase-with-hyphens`
- Ensure all internal links work correctly throughout the document
- Pattern names in "Related Patterns" sections MUST always be hyperlinked

## Pattern Structure

Each pattern MUST follow this exact structure:

### Pattern Header
```markdown
### Pattern Name

**Maturity**: [Beginner|Intermediate|Advanced]  
**Description**: [One-sentence description of what the pattern accomplishes]

**Related Patterns**: [List of hyperlinked related patterns]
```

### Required Content Sections

1. **Core Implementation** - Single primary example showing pattern in action
2. **Anti-pattern** - What NOT to do, with specific example

**Note**: Each pattern should contain exactly ONE core implementation example to maintain clarity and focus. Multiple examples create confusion and dilute the pattern's message.

### Pattern Categories

Patterns are organized into three main categories:

- **Foundation Patterns**: Team readiness and basic AI integration infrastructure
- **Development Patterns**: Daily coding workflows and tactical approaches
- **Operations Patterns**: CI/CD, security, compliance, and production management
  - Sub-categories: Security & Compliance, Deployment Automation, Monitoring & Maintenance

## Content Requirements

### Pattern Name
- Use descriptive, action-oriented names
- Avoid generic terms like "AI Pattern" or "Best Practice"
- Examples: "Policy-as-Code Generation", "Specification Driven Development"

### Maturity Levels
- **Beginner**: No prerequisites, immediate implementation, low complexity
- **Intermediate**: Requires foundation patterns, moderate complexity, some AI experience
- **Advanced**: Complex dependencies, high expertise required, sophisticated implementation

### Description
- Single sentence that clearly states the pattern's purpose
- Focus on outcomes and value delivered
- Avoid implementation details in the description

### Related Patterns
- Link to 1-3 most relevant patterns using markdown hyperlinks
- Include patterns this one depends on or builds upon
- Avoid circular references

### Core Implementation
- Provide ONE concrete, focused example that demonstrates the pattern's key concepts
- Keep examples concise enough to understand quickly while being specific enough to implement
- Use real commands, file paths, and tool names
- Show essential code snippets that illustrate the pattern, not complete implementations
- For complex patterns, reference detailed implementations in `examples/pattern-name/` directories
- Focus on the most important use case rather than showing multiple approaches

### Anti-patterns
- Name the anti-pattern with a descriptive title
- Explain why it's problematic
- Provide specific consequences
- Examples: "Manual Policy Translation", "Alert Fatigue", "Blind Chaos Testing"

## Formatting Standards

### Code Blocks
- Use appropriate language tags (bash, yaml, json, python, etc.)
- Include comments explaining non-obvious steps
- Use realistic file paths and tool names
- Show both input and expected output where applicable

### Hyperlinks
- ALL pattern references MUST be hyperlinked using format: `[Pattern Name](#pattern-name-anchor)`
- This applies to: Reference table, Related Patterns sections, pattern mentions in descriptions, implementation examples, and any other pattern references
- External links should include brief context
- Ensure all internal links work correctly
- Use consistent anchor naming: convert pattern names to lowercase with hyphens replacing spaces and special characters

### Examples
- Each pattern should have exactly ONE example in the README to maintain focus and clarity
- Keep README examples concise: 20-50 lines of code maximum
- Show the pattern's essence, not exhaustive implementation details
- For complex patterns requiring extensive code, create `examples/pattern-name/` directories
- Reference detailed implementations with clear links: "See [examples/pattern-name/](examples/pattern-name/) for complete implementation"
- Prefer real-world scenarios over abstract examples
- Use consistent naming conventions (e.g., "myapp" for applications)
- Include essential file paths and command outputs, not comprehensive listings

### Examples Directory Structure
For complex patterns requiring extensive implementation details:

- Create `examples/pattern-name/` directory with complete, working implementations
- Include `README.md` in examples directory explaining the full implementation
- Provide all necessary configuration files, scripts, and dependencies
- Examples directory should be immediately runnable with clear setup instructions
- Use examples directory for:
  - Multi-file implementations (>3 files)
  - Complex configuration setups
  - Complete working applications demonstrating the pattern
  - Advanced usage scenarios and variations

## Quality Standards

### Actionability
- Each pattern must be immediately implementable
- Provide specific commands, not general guidance
- Include validation steps where appropriate

### Specificity
- Address specific problems, not general categories
- Provide concrete examples rather than abstract concepts
- Focus on practical implementation details

### Completeness
- Include all necessary context for implementation
- Address common failure modes through anti-patterns
- Provide clear success criteria where applicable

## Pattern Dependencies

### Dependency Rules
- Foundation patterns should have minimal dependencies
- Development patterns can depend on Foundation patterns
- Operations patterns can depend on both Foundation and Development patterns
- Avoid circular dependencies between patterns

### Reference Table Requirements
- MUST be the first major section after introduction/overview
- Include maturity level, category, and brief description for each pattern
- List primary dependencies for each pattern
- Organize by logical grouping (Foundation → Development → Operations)
- Every pattern name MUST be a working hyperlink to its section
- Use category headers to group related patterns visually
- Maintain consistent formatting across all entries

## Writing Style

### Tone
- Direct and action-oriented
- Assume reader familiarity with basic AI tools
- Focus on practical implementation over theory
- Use imperative voice for instructions

### Technical Accuracy
- Test all commands and scripts before publication
- Use current tool versions and syntax
- Verify all hyperlinks work correctly
- Ensure examples match real-world usage

### Consistency
- Use consistent terminology throughout
- Follow established naming conventions
- Maintain parallel structure across similar patterns
- Use the same format for all patterns

## Validation Checklist

Before adding a new pattern, verify:

- [ ] Follows exact header structure
- [ ] Has clear, single-sentence description
- [ ] Includes appropriate maturity level
- [ ] Contains exactly ONE working code example
- [ ] Defines specific anti-pattern
- [ ] Uses correct markdown formatting
- [ ] Links to related patterns correctly
- [ ] Addresses specific, actionable problem
- [ ] Dependencies are clearly stated
- [ ] Example is realistic and testable
- [ ] Writing is clear and concise
- [ ] Fits logically within existing pattern organization
- [ ] Added to Complete Pattern Reference table with correct hyperlink
- [ ] All pattern references throughout document are hyperlinked
- [ ] Internal anchor link works correctly from reference table
- [ ] Does not include multiple examples or implementation approaches

## Pattern Evolution

### Updates
- Patterns may evolve based on tool updates and community feedback
- Maintain backward compatibility in examples where possible
- Update dependencies when patterns are modified
- Document significant changes in commit messages

### Deprecation
- Mark deprecated patterns clearly
- Provide migration path to replacement patterns
- Remove deprecated patterns after reasonable transition period
- Update all references when patterns are removed

This specification ensures consistency, quality, and usability across all patterns in the AI Development Patterns collection.

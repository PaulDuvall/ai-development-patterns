# AI Development Patterns Specification

This document defines the standard structure, content requirements, and formatting guidelines for AI development patterns in this collection.

## Document Structure Requirements

### Complete Pattern Reference Table
The main documentation MUST include a comprehensive reference table at the beginning that:
- Lists ALL patterns in the collection
- Includes maturity level, category, description, and dependencies for each pattern
- Provides internal reference links to each pattern using format: `[Pattern Name](#pattern-name-anchor)`
- Organizes patterns by category (Foundation → Development → Operations)
- Uses sub-category headers for Operations patterns (Security & Compliance, Deployment Automation, Monitoring & Maintenance)

### Internal Reference Links
- EVERY pattern mentioned anywhere in the document MUST be hyperlinked to its section
- Use consistent anchor format: `#pattern-name-in-lowercase-with-hyphens`
- Ensure all internal links work correctly throughout the document
- Pattern names in "Related Patterns" sections MUST always be hyperlinked

## Pattern Structure

Each pattern MUST follow this exact structure:

### Pattern Header
```markdown
### Pattern Name

**Maturity**: [Beginner|Intermediate|Advanced]  
**Description**: [One-sentence description of what the pattern accomplishes]

**Related Patterns**: [List of hyperlinked related patterns]
```

### Required Content Sections

1. **Implementation Section** - Primary examples showing pattern in action (flexible section naming: "Core Implementation", "Assessment Framework", "Workflow Implementation", etc.)
2. **Anti-pattern** - What NOT to do, with specific example

**Note**: Each pattern should focus on the most important implementation approaches without overwhelming detail. Complex patterns may include multiple focused examples if they demonstrate different aspects of the same core concept.

### Pattern Categories

Patterns are organized into three main categories:

- **Foundation Patterns**: Team readiness and basic AI integration infrastructure
- **Development Patterns**: Daily coding workflows and tactical approaches
- **Operations Patterns**: CI/CD, security, compliance, and production management
  - Sub-categories: Security & Compliance, Deployment Automation, Monitoring & Maintenance

## Content Requirements

### Pattern Name
- Use descriptive, action-oriented names
- Avoid generic terms like "AI Pattern" or "Best Practice"
- Examples: "Policy-as-Code Generation", "Specification Driven Development"

### Maturity Levels
- **Beginner**: No prerequisites, immediate implementation, low complexity
- **Intermediate**: Requires foundation patterns, moderate complexity, some AI experience
- **Advanced**: Complex dependencies, high expertise required, sophisticated implementation

### Description
- Single sentence that clearly states the pattern's purpose
- Focus on outcomes and value delivered
- Avoid implementation details in the description

### Related Patterns
- Link to 1-3 most relevant patterns using markdown hyperlinks
- Include patterns this one depends on or builds upon
- Avoid circular references

### Implementation Sections
- Provide concrete, focused examples that demonstrate the pattern's key concepts
- Keep primary examples concise and scannable (aim for clarity over strict line limits)
- Use real commands, file paths, and tool names to show the pattern's essence
- Show the most critical code snippets that illustrate the core concept
- ALWAYS reference detailed implementations in `examples/pattern-name/` directories for complete working code
- Focus on the most important use cases that capture the pattern's value
- Complex patterns may include multiple examples if they address different aspects (e.g., workflow diagrams + code examples + configuration)

### Anti-patterns
- Name the anti-pattern with a descriptive title
- Explain why it's problematic
- Provide specific consequences
- Examples: "Manual Policy Translation", "Alert Fatigue", "Blind Chaos Testing"

## Formatting Standards

### Code Blocks
- Use appropriate language tags (bash, yaml, json, python, etc.)
- Include comments explaining non-obvious steps
- Use realistic file paths and tool names
- Show both input and expected output where applicable

### Diagrams
Consider adding diagrams when the pattern would benefit from visual explanation:

**When to use diagrams:**
- Multi-step workflows or processes (use flowcharts)
- System interactions or data flow (use sequence diagrams)
- Component relationships or architecture (use component diagrams)
- State transitions or decision trees (use state diagrams)
- Timeline-based processes (use timeline or Gantt charts)

**Diagram guidelines:**
- Use Mermaid syntax for consistency and maintainability
- Place diagrams where they best support understanding (typically after description or within implementation sections)
- Keep diagrams simple and focused on the core concept
- Label all components clearly with descriptive names
- Use consistent styling and colors within the same pattern
- Use diagrams judiciously - include them when they clarify complex workflows, relationships, or processes

**Mermaid diagram types to consider:**

**Flowchart for decision flows and processes:**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B{Decision}
    B -->|Yes| C[Action 1]
    B -->|No| D[Action 2]
```

**Sequence diagram for interactions over time:**
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant AI
    User->>AI: Request
    AI->>User: Response
```

**Component diagram for system architecture:**
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Component A] --> B[Component B]
    B --> C[Component C]
```

### Hyperlinks
- ALL pattern references MUST be hyperlinked using format: `[Pattern Name](#pattern-name-anchor)`
- This applies to: Reference table, Related Patterns sections, pattern mentions in descriptions, implementation examples, and any other pattern references
- External links should include brief context
- Ensure all internal links work correctly
- Use consistent anchor naming: convert pattern names to lowercase with hyphens replacing spaces and special characters

### Examples
- Each pattern should include focused examples that demonstrate the core concept clearly
- Keep README examples concise and scannable (prioritize clarity and understanding)
- Show the pattern's essence and core value proposition with practical detail
- For complex patterns, create `examples/pattern-name/` directories with complete working code
- ALWAYS reference detailed implementations: "Complete Example: See [examples/pattern-name/](examples/pattern-name/) for..." or "Complete Implementation: See [examples/pattern-name/](examples/pattern-name/) for..."
- Prefer real-world scenarios over abstract examples
- Use consistent naming conventions (e.g., "myapp" for applications)
- Include the most important commands, code snippets, or configurations that demonstrate the pattern
- Complex patterns may include multiple examples (workflow diagrams, code samples, configuration files) if they illustrate different essential aspects

### Examples Directory Structure
For complex patterns requiring extensive implementation details:

- Create `examples/pattern-name/` directory with complete, working implementations
- Include `README.md` in examples directory explaining the full implementation
- Provide all necessary configuration files, scripts, and dependencies
- Examples directory should be immediately runnable with clear setup instructions
- Use examples directory for:
  - Multi-file implementations (>3 files)
  - Complex configuration setups
  - Complete working applications demonstrating the pattern
  - Advanced usage scenarios and variations

### Experiments Directory Structure
For experimental or future patterns not yet ready for the main documentation:

- Create `experiments/examples/pattern-name/` directory for experimental implementations
- Each experimental pattern should have its own subdirectory with descriptive naming
- Include `README.md` in each experimental directory explaining:
  - The experimental concept being explored
  - Current implementation status
  - Known limitations or areas for development
  - Potential path to becoming a full pattern
- Use experiments directory for:
  - Early-stage pattern exploration and validation
  - Advanced concepts requiring further research
  - Patterns dependent on emerging tools or techniques
  - Complex multi-pattern integrations being tested
- Experimental patterns should follow the same code quality standards as main patterns
- Consider adding experimental patterns to main documentation once they're validated and stable

## Quality Standards

### Actionability
- Each pattern must be immediately implementable
- Provide specific commands, not general guidance
- Include validation steps where appropriate

### Specificity
- Address specific problems, not general categories
- Provide concrete examples rather than abstract concepts
- Focus on practical implementation details

### Completeness
- Include all necessary context for implementation
- Address common failure modes through anti-patterns
- Provide clear success criteria where applicable

## Pattern Dependencies

### Dependency Rules
- Foundation patterns should have minimal dependencies
- Development patterns can depend on Foundation patterns
- Operations patterns can depend on both Foundation and Development patterns
- Avoid circular dependencies between patterns

### Reference Table Requirements
- MUST be the first major section after introduction/overview
- Include maturity level, category, and brief description for each pattern
- List primary dependencies for each pattern
- Organize by logical grouping (Foundation → Development → Operations)
- Every pattern name MUST be a working hyperlink to its section
- Use category headers to group related patterns visually
- Maintain consistent formatting across all entries

## Writing Style

### Tone
- Direct and action-oriented
- Assume reader familiarity with basic AI tools
- Focus on practical implementation over theory
- Use imperative voice for instructions

### Technical Accuracy
- Test all commands and scripts before publication
- Use current tool versions and syntax
- Verify all hyperlinks work correctly
- Ensure examples match real-world usage

### Consistency
- Use consistent terminology throughout
- Follow established naming conventions
- Maintain parallel structure across similar patterns
- Use the same format for all patterns
